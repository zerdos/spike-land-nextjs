 * Usage:
 *   import { PomodoroTimer } from "@spike-land/react-app-examples";
 *
 * Or dynamic import:
 *   const App = lazy(() => import("@spike-land/react-app-examples/utility/pomodoro-timer"));

// then use `yarn sync` to copy completed apps here.
//
// Apps will be exported like:
// export { default as PomodoroTimer } from "./utility/pomodoro-timer";
// export { default as TodoListClassic } from "./productivity/todo-list-classic";
