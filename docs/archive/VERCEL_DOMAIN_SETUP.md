# Vercel Domain Setup for next.spike.land

This guide explains how to configure your custom domain `next.spike.land` on Vercel.

## Vercel Configuration

1. **Log in to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Navigate to your project**: Select `spike-land-nextjs` project

3. **Go to Settings â†’ Domains**

4. **Add Custom Domain**:
   - Click "Add"
   - Enter: `next.spike.land`
   - Click "Add"

5. **Vercel will provide DNS records**:
   - You'll see instructions showing what DNS records to add
   - Typically it will be a CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

6. **Production Domain Assignment**:
   - Once the domain is verified, go to "Domains" settings
   - Make sure `next.spike.land` is marked as the **Production Domain**
   - If it's not, click on the domain and select "Set as Production Domain"

## Important Notes

- **Production Deployment**: The main branch will automatically deploy to `next.spike.land` after domain is configured
- **Preview Deployments**: All other branches will continue to get unique preview URLs
- **SSL Certificate**: Vercel automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates for your custom domain
- **Propagation Time**: DNS changes may take up to 48 hours to propagate globally (usually faster)

## Verification

After adding the DNS records in Cloudflare (see CLOUDFLARE_DNS_SETUP.md):

1. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
2. Vercel will automatically verify the domain
3. Once verified, you'll see a green checkmark next to the domain
4. Future pushes to `main` branch will deploy to `next.spike.land`

## Troubleshooting

- **Domain verification fails**: Double-check DNS records in Cloudflare match Vercel's requirements
- **SSL certificate issues**: Ensure Cloudflare SSL mode is set to "Full" or "Full (strict)"
- **Deployment not showing on custom domain**: Ensure the domain is set as "Production Domain" in Vercel settings
