## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Poor Product Hunt Performance

**Likelihood**: Medium **Impact**: High (missed momentum, lower visibility)

**Mitigation**:

- Prepare assets 2 weeks in advance
- Reach out to hunters with track record
- Pre-build audience through Weeks 3-4 content
- Have backup launch date if initial timing is bad

**Contingency**:

- Re-launch on Product Hunt 3-6 months later with new features
- Focus on other channels (Hacker News, Reddit, direct outreach)

### Risk 2: High Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Likelihood**: Medium **Impact**: High (unsustainable economics)

**Mitigation**:

- Start with small daily budgets ($50-100)
- A/B test creatives and audiences extensively
- Focus on organic channels first
- Only scale ads that have <$20 CAC

**Contingency**:

- Pause paid ads, focus on organic + community
- Improve product to increase word-of-mouth
- Build affiliate/referral program for lower-cost acquisition

### Risk 3: Message Confusion (Vibe Coding vs. Social Media)

**Likelihood**: Medium **Impact**: Medium (brand confusion, lower conversions)

**Mitigation**:

- Clear messaging in all materials: "We pivoted from X to Y"
- FAQ addressing "What happened to vibe coding?"
- Emphasize new value proposition in every touchpoint

**Contingency**:

- Simplify messaging further
- Create comparison page showing old vs. new
- Personal outreach to confused users

### Risk 4: Content Burnout (Solo Founder)

**Likelihood**: High **Impact**: Medium (content quality/frequency drops)

**Mitigation**:

- Batch content creation (write 4-8 posts in one session)
- Use spike.land's own AI tools for content generation
- Focus on fewer channels but higher quality
- Hire part-time contractor if revenue allows

**Contingency**:

- Reduce content frequency but maintain quality
- Focus on high-impact channels (Twitter, blog, email)
- Pause low-ROI channels temporarily

### Risk 5: Competitor Response

**Likelihood**: Medium **Impact**: Low (established players may not care yet)

**Mitigation**:

- Move fast, ship features quickly
- Build strong community that competitors can't replicate overnight
- Focus on developer-friendly features that incumbents don't have (MCP, API)

**Contingency**:

- Double down on unique differentiators
- Out-community, out-transparency, out-care the competition
