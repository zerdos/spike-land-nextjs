## Twitter Thread

### Main Thread (10-15 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

```
I built the perfect developer tool.

Beautiful UI. Claude Code integration. Live React environments.

Almost nobody used it.

Here's what I learned about marketing, pivots, and why "if you build it, they will come" is a lie. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2**

```
For months, I poured everything into spike.land.

The vision: vibe coding. Build production apps just by talking to AI. No setup. No deployment headaches.

The tech worked. Demos were impressive. Early users loved it.

But we had a problem.
```

**Tweet 3**

```
Nobody could find us.

App store visibility? Driven by marketing spend, not quality.

Our AI image app (Pixel) sat in stores with almost zero organic downloads. Not because it was bad.

Because we had no marketing infrastructure.
```

**Tweet 4**

```
The competitors ranking first?

• Marketing teams ✅
• Ad budgets ✅
• Paid acquisition strategies ✅

Us?

• Good code ✅
• No visibility ❌

I learned the hard way: marketing is not optional.
```

**Tweet 5**

```
So I did what developers do.

I built a tool to solve my problem.

"Orbit" - internal tooling to manage Pixel's marketing:
• AI-powered content generation
• Multi-platform scheduling
• Automated A/B testing
• Analytics tracking

Everything I needed as a solo founder.
```

**Tweet 6**

```
And then I realized something.

Orbit was more interesting than the vibe coding platform.

The side project was actually the main project.

Every solo creator has this problem. We can build amazing things. But we can't get them in front of people.
```

**Tweet 7**

```
So spike.land is pivoting.

From: "Vibe Coding Platform"
To: "AI-Powered Social Media Command Center"

Orbit is now the main product. Vibe coding? Still there as a feature.

Because sometimes you need to spin up React apps to create marketing graphics.
```

**Tweet 8**

```
What changed:

Before:
• For developers who want to code faster
• Core feature: Live React apps
• Distribution: App stores

Now:
• For creators who want to grow faster
• Core feature: AI content management
• Distribution: Direct to creators
```

**Tweet 9**

```
Who it's for:

1. Solo content creators building an audience
2. Small businesses managing their own marketing
3. Freelance marketers juggling multiple clients

If you're exhausted managing 6 different social platforms, this is for you.
```

**Tweet 10**

```
Features:

• AI learns your brand voice
• Schedule posts across Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Discord
• Automated A/B testing
• Real-time analytics
• MCP integration (use from Claude Code)
• Live React environments for visuals
```

**Tweet 11**

```
Why this matters:

Marketing is THE blocker for indie builders now.

We can code. Claude helps with that.

But getting people to SEE what we built? That's the unsolved problem.

spike.land is solving it.
```

**Tweet 12**

```
The lesson:

"If you build it, they will come" only works in movies.

In reality:
• Best product ≠ most visibility
• Marketing is not optional
• Distribution matters more than features

I learned this the hard way. Now I'm solving it.
```

**Tweet 13**

```
The 3-month plan:

Weeks 1-2: Soft launch, gather feedback
Weeks 3-4: Content marketing (this thread!)
Weeks 5-6: Product Hunt launch
Weeks 7-8: Paid advertising
Weeks 9+: Sustained content engine

This is just the beginning.
```

**Tweet 14**

```
If you made it this far:

spike.land is live now. Connect your accounts, let AI help you create content, and actually get your work in front of people.

### Professional Pivot Announcement

**Optimal length**: 1,300 characters (LinkedIn sweet spot)

**Title**: Why We Pivoted From Developer Tool to Creator Platform

Over the past six months, I've learned an uncomfortable truth about building
products: quality doesn't guarantee visibility.

I built spike.land as a vibe coding platform. Beautiful tech. Claude Code
integration. Live React environments. Everything developers could want.

But our AI image app (Pixel) sat in app stores with almost zero organic
downloads. Not because it was bad—because we had no marketing infrastructure.

**The Problem:**

App store visibility is driven by marketing spend, not product quality. The
competitors ranking first have marketing teams and ad budgets. We had neither.

**The Solution:**

I built internal tooling to manage Pixel's marketing. AI-powered content
generation, multi-platform scheduling, automated A/B testing. Everything a solo
founder needs to actually do marketing.

Then I realized: this internal tool was solving a bigger problem than the
original product.

**The Pivot:**

spike.land is now an AI-powered social media command center for solo creators,
small businesses, and freelance marketers.

We're solving the distribution problem. Because you can build the best product
in the world, but if nobody knows about it, you're doomed.

**Who It's For:**

• Solo content creators building an audience • Small business owners managing
their own marketing • Freelance social media managers juggling clients

**What Makes It Different:**

• AI that learns your brand voice (not generic content) • Multi-platform
scheduling (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Discord) •
Automated A/B testing • MCP integration for developers • Token-based pricing
(pay for what you use)

**Lesson Learned:**

Marketing is not optional. It's not something you do "when you have time." It's
the actual blocker for most products today.

We can all build. But getting people to see what we built? That's the challenge.

spike.land is solving it.

### Email Body (HTML)

#### Existing User Segment

**Subject**: We're pivoting. Here's why.

Hi [First Name],

I need to tell you something.

spike.land is pivoting.

You signed up for a vibe coding platform. Live React apps. Claude Code
integration. Developer tools.

And we're still doing that. But it's not the main product anymore.

**What Changed:**

Over the past few months, I've been using spike.land to market Pixel (our AI
image app). I built internal tooling to manage social media across 6 platforms.
AI content generation. Automated scheduling. A/B testing.

And I realized: this internal tool solves a bigger problem than vibe coding
ever did.

Every solo creator, every small business, every freelance marketer has the same
problem. We can build amazing things. But we can't get them in front of people.

**The New spike.land:**

AI-powered social media command center for creators.

• Connect all your accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube,
Discord) • Let AI generate content in your brand voice • Schedule posts across
platforms • Run A/B tests automatically • Track what works

The vibe coding features? Still there. You'll need them when creating visual
content for social media.

But the focus has shifted: from building faster to growing faster.

**Why This Matters to You:**

If you're a developer, you need this. Because the best code means nothing if
nobody sees it.

If you're a creator, you need this. Because managing 6 social platforms
manually is exhausting.

If you're building anything, you need this. Because distribution is harder than
creation now.

**Special Offer:**

As an existing user, you get 10,000 bonus tokens (normally £50 value). That's
enough for ~500 AI-generated posts or 50 image generations.

No action needed. The tokens are already in your account.

**What's Next:**

Try the new features. Give me feedback. Tell me what's missing.

This pivot is based on my own pain. But I want it to solve yours too.

Thanks for being part of spike.land.

**Email 2: First Post Tips (sent 2 days later if no post created)**

Subject: Tips for your first AI-generated post

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't posted yet. That's okay! Here are some tips to get
started:

**1. Start simple**

Don't overthink it. Just describe what you want to say. The AI will handle the
formatting, hashtags, and tone.

Example: "Announce our new feature: dark mode. Make it exciting but
professional."

**2. Teach the AI your voice**

The first few posts, you might need to edit the output. That's normal. Each
edit helps the AI learn your style.

**3. Schedule, don't stress**

You don't have to post immediately. Schedule it for later when your audience is
most active.

**Quick win:**

Try this prompt: "Create a post introducing myself and what I do. Keep it
friendly and authentic."

[Generate Post Button]

Any questions? Just reply.

**Email 3: Feature Deep Dive (sent 5 days later)**

Subject: The feature you're probably not using (but should)

Hi [First Name],

Most people use spike.land for scheduling posts.

But the most powerful feature is A/B testing.

**Here's how it works:**

1. Create two versions of a post
2. AI publishes both at optimal times
3. spike.land tracks which performs better
4. Future posts use the winning style

You learn what resonates without guessing.

**Try it today:**

[Create A/B Test Button]

**Example use case:**

Test: "Should my posts be formal or casual?" Test: "Do questions or statements
get more engagement?" Test: "Long-form or short-form content?"

spike.land will tell you what works for YOUR audience.

Zoltan

**Email 4: Token Reminder (sent when <100 tokens remain)**

Subject: You're running low on tokens (here's how to get more)

Hi [First Name],

You have [X] tokens left.

**Options:**

1. **Buy more tokens** (£10 = 1,000 tokens) [Buy Tokens Button]

2. **Upgrade to Pro** (20,000 tokens/month + 20% discount) [See Plans Button]

3. **Refer friends** (500 tokens per successful referral) [Get Referral Link
   Button]

**What can you do with tokens?**

• 1,000 tokens = ~50 AI posts • 1,000 tokens = ~5 images (TIER_1K) • 1,000
tokens = ~100 brand voice applications

Thanks for using spike.land!

## Response Templates (for Community Engagement)

**Question: "How is this different from Buffer?"**

```
Great question! spike.land is AI-first from the ground up. We don't just schedule - we help you CREATE content in your brand voice, run A/B tests automatically, and integrate with dev tools like Claude Code. Plus, token-based pricing instead of per-seat subscriptions means you only pay for what you use.
```

**Question: "Does this work for [specific platform]?"**

```
Currently we support Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Discord. [Platform] is on our roadmap for Q2 2026. Want to help prioritize it? Join our Discord and vote on the feature roadmap!
```

**Question: "Can I try before paying?"**

```
Yes! Every new user gets 1,000 free tokens (£10 value) to test all features. That's enough for ~50 AI-generated posts. No credit card required to start.
```

**Question: "Is my data secure?"**

```
Absolutely. OAuth tokens are AES-256-GCM encrypted. We never store passwords. API calls use secure connections. Full privacy policy at spike.land/privacy. Happy to answer specific security questions!
```

**Negative feedback: "AI content is generic"**

```
Totally hear you - most AI tools DO produce generic content. That's why spike.land focuses on learning YOUR specific brand voice. The first few posts you might need to edit, but the AI learns from those edits and gets better at matching your style. It's not about replacing your voice, it's about scaling it.
