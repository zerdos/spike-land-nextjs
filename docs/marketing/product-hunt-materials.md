No more juggling 6 different platforms. No more writer's block staring at
blank post boxes. No more guessing which content will perform.

own products and couldn't find tools that actually worked.

  Discord)
- Automated A/B testing for posts
- Real-time analytics and engagement tracking
- MCP server integration for Claude Code/Desktop
- Live React environments for visual content creation

- Freelance social media managers juggling multiple clients

Built with: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma, Cloudflare Workers, Claude AI

## First Comment (Founder Introduction)

Post this immediately after launch to set the tone and context.

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Zoltan, and I built spike.land.

**The Problem I Had:**

I built an AI image enhancement app called Pixel. Great product. Barely any
users.

Why? Because I'm a developer, not a marketer. I had no idea how to get people
to see it. App store visibility requires marketing budgets I didn't have.

I looked at social media management tools. Hootsuite, Buffer, Later - they're
fine, but they're not designed for developers or small teams. And they
definitely don't use AI the way I needed.

**So I Built My Own:**

spike.land started as internal tooling to market Pixel. AI-powered content
generation. Multi-platform scheduling. A/B testing. Everything I needed as a
solo founder to actually do marketing.

Then I realized: this is the problem every solo creator faces. We can build
amazing things, but we can't get them in front of people.

**What Makes spike.land Different:**

1. **AI that learns your voice** - Not generic content. Your brand voice,
   consistently applied.
2. **MCP integration** - Use it from Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or the web
   app. Your choice.
3. **Built for developers** - TypeScript SDK. REST API. Webhook support. All
   the things devs expect.
4. **Live React environments** - Need custom graphics? Spin up a React app
   instantly, export, post.
5. **Transparent pricing** - Token-based. You pay for what you use, not per
   seat.

**What I'm Looking For:**

- Early users who will give honest feedback
- Feature requests from people actually doing social media marketing
- Bug reports (there will be bugs!)
- Ideas for integrations you'd actually use

**Special Launch Offer:**

First 100 Product Hunt users get 10,000 bonus tokens (normally £50 value).
That's enough for ~500 AI-generated posts or 50 image generations.

Just sign up and mention you came from Product Hunt.

**Try it**: https://spike.land

**Questions?** I'll be here all day answering everything.

Thanks for checking it out!

Zoltan

## Hunter Strategy

**Why use a hunter?**

- Hunters with large followings can amplify your launch
- Some hunters specialize in specific categories (SaaS, AI, productivity)
- Hunter's network can mean better initial visibility

**How to find a hunter:**

1. Browse Product Hunt and note hunters who launch products in your category
2. Check their follower count (aim for 10k+)
3. Review their past launches (success rate, engagement quality)
4. Reach out 2-3 weeks before launch with a personalized message

**Message template:**

```
Hi [Hunter Name],

I'm Zoltan, founder of spike.land - an AI-powered social media command center
for solo creators and small businesses.

I'm planning to launch on Product Hunt in [timeframe], and I noticed you've
hunted several successful [category] products. I love your work on [specific
product they hunted].

Would you be interested in hunting spike.land? I think it would resonate with
your audience because [specific reason].

Happy to provide early access and answer any questions.

Zoltan
spike.land
```

**Alternative: Self-launch**

Self-launching can be more authentic. You own the narrative. Direct relationship
with the community. Many successful launches are self-launched.

**Recommendation**: Try self-launch first. It's more work but builds genuine
community connection.
