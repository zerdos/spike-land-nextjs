### Customer Background

```markdown
## About [Customer Name/Type]

[2-3 paragraphs describing the customer]

**Include:**

- Who they are (person or business)
- What they do (industry, niche)
- Their experience level with social media
- Size of their operation (team size, revenue if relevant)
- Geographic location (optional, can be anonymized)

**Example:**

Sarah Chen is a freelance social media manager based in Manchester. She
specializes in helping small e-commerce brands build their Instagram and TikTok
presence. When we met her, she was managing 4 clients but struggling to take on
more without burning out.
```

### The Challenge

```markdown
## The Challenge

[3-4 paragraphs describing the problem they faced before spike.land]

**Structure:**

1. Primary pain point (the biggest problem)
2. Secondary pain points (supporting issues)
3. What they tried before (failed solutions)
4. Why those solutions didn't work
5. The "breaking point" moment (what made them look for spike.land)

**Questions to answer:**

- What was broken in their current process?
- What tools were they using? Why weren't those working?
- What was the cost of NOT solving this problem? (time, money, stress, missed
  opportunities)
- What specific trigger made them decide to find a solution?

**Example:**

Sarah's biggest challenge was time. Each client required content across 3-4
platforms. She spent 3-4 hours per day just drafting posts, checking them
against brand guidelines, and scheduling them across different tools.

She tried using Buffer and Hootsuite, but they didn't help with content
creation - just scheduling. She was still staring at blank text boxes, trying
to write on-brand content for 4 different companies with 4 different voices.

By the time she finished her daily content creation, she had no time left for
strategy, client calls, or taking on new business. She was stuck at 4 clients
because she literally couldn't manage more.

The breaking point came when she had to turn down two high-paying clients in
the same week because she didn't have capacity.
```

### The Solution

```markdown
## How spike.land Helped

[3-4 paragraphs describing how they use spike.land to solve their problem]

**Structure:**

1. Initial setup (what they did first)
2. Key features they use (be specific)
3. Workflow changes (how their day-to-day changed)
4. Learning curve (was it easy to adopt?)

**Questions to answer:**

- What features do they use most?
- How did they configure spike.land for their needs?
- What was their onboarding experience like?
- How long before they saw results?
- What surprised them about the solution?

**Include:**

- Specific feature names (AI brand voice, multi-platform scheduling, A/B
  testing, etc.)
- Workflow descriptions (step-by-step of how they use it)
- Screenshots if available (dashboard, content generation, analytics)
- Direct quotes from customer about the experience

**Example:**

Sarah started by connecting all her clients' social accounts to spike.land. She
configured a separate brand voice profile for each client, feeding the AI
examples of past posts that worked well.

The first week, she spent time training the AI. She'd generate drafts, edit
them to match the brand perfectly, and the AI learned from her edits.

By week two, the AI was producing content that needed minimal editing. Sarah's
workflow changed dramatically:

1. Morning: Review AI-generated content for all clients (30 minutes)
2. Edit as needed (15 minutes per client)
3. Schedule with optimal timing suggestions (10 minutes)
4. Done by 10 AM instead of 2 PM

The A/B testing feature was a game-changer. Instead of guessing what content
would perform, spike.land would test variations and learn what resonated with
each audience.

"I went from spending 4 hours a day on content to spending 1 hour. And the
content is BETTER because the AI learned what actually works, not what I think
will work." - Sarah
```

### The Results

```markdown
## The Results

[3-4 paragraphs describing measurable outcomes]

**Structure:**

1. Primary result (the biggest win)
2. Secondary results (supporting wins)
3. Unexpected benefits (things they didn't anticipate)
4. Long-term impact (how this changed their business/life)

**Questions to answer:**

- What changed measurably? (time saved, revenue increased, engagement up, etc.)
- What changed qualitatively? (less stress, more time for strategy, better
  work-life balance)
- What can they do now that they couldn't before?
- How has this impacted their business/career trajectory?

**Include:**

- Specific numbers and percentages
- Before/after comparisons
- Screenshots of analytics if available
- Testimonial quotes highlighting results

**Example:**

Within 30 days of using spike.land, Sarah's workflow had transformed:

- **Time saved**: 15 hours per week (from 20 hours on content creation to 5
  hours)
- **Clients taken on**: Went from 4 to 7 clients in 60 days
- **Revenue increase**: 75% increase in monthly revenue
- **Engagement rates**: Average engagement up 40% across all clients due to
  A/B-tested content

But the numbers don't tell the whole story. Sarah now has time for strategic
consulting with her clients - the high-value work that justifies her rates. She
took on a part-time team member. She has evenings and weekends free.

"spike.land didn't just save me time. It gave me my life back. I can grow my
business without working 60-hour weeks. That's priceless." - Sarah

The unexpected benefit? Client retention improved. Because Sarah had time to
focus on strategy and results instead of just churning out content, her clients
saw better results and stayed longer.
```

### Lessons Learned

```markdown
## Lessons Learned

[2-3 paragraphs sharing insights and advice]

**Include:**

- What the customer learned during this process
- What they'd do differently if starting over
- Advice for others in similar situations
- Best practices they discovered

**Example:**

Sarah's advice for other social media managers considering spike.land:

**1. Train the AI properly**: "Don't expect perfect content on day one. Spend
the first week teaching it your brand voice. It's worth the investment."

**2. Use A/B testing from the start**: "I wasted months guessing what content
would work. Let the data decide."

**3. Set up workflows**: "I created templates for different content types
(product launches, behind-the-scenes, customer testimonials). Now I can use the
same prompts and get consistent results."

**4. Don't skip analytics**: "The dashboard shows you what's working. Use that
data to refine your strategy."

The biggest lesson? "Marketing doesn't have to be manual labor. Automate the
repetitive stuff so you can focus on the creative and strategic work that
actually matters."
```
