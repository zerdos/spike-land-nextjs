# The Trust Gap: Why Teams Reject AI-Generated Code

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

I knew something was wrong when my PR sat untouched for three days.

The code was good. The tests passed. The feature worked exactly as requested. I had checked everything twice. But nobody would approve it.

Then I heard the conversation in the break room. "That one from Zoltan? I will just rewrite it myself. Faster than reviewing all that AI stuff."

That is when I understood. They were not reviewing my work. They were avoiding it.

## The Pattern I Could Not Ignore

Every developer knows this feeling: you submit a PR and wait. Sometimes the wait is short. Sometimes it takes longer. But there is a different kind of waiting. The kind where your PR sits in a queue that never moves.

My PRs started taking three to four times longer to review than my colleagues' work. Same size. Same complexity. Same feature area. But mine would sit there while others flew through.

At first, I thought I was doing something wrong. Maybe my code had problems. Maybe I was missing something obvious. So I worked harder. I added more tests. I wrote better documentation. I made my PRs smaller.

Nothing changed.

The truth was simpler and more painful. Everything coming from me was treated differently. Not because of what I wrote. Because of how I wrote it.

## When Trust Breaks Down

Here is what I learned about trust in software teams: it is fragile. And once people decide you are using AI, that trust can break very fast.

My colleagues would rather redo my entire PR than give me feedback. Think about that. They preferred to spend hours rewriting work from scratch instead of spending minutes telling me what to fix.

This makes no sense if you think about code quality. But it makes perfect sense if you think about trust.

When a developer sees code they believe came from AI, something changes in their mind. They stop seeing code. They start seeing a threat. Not a threat to the codebase. A threat to themselves.

They think: if AI can write this code, what does that mean for me?

## The Fear Nobody Talks About

I do not want to have those fights anymore. The ones where someone says "there is something wrong with it" before they even look at the code. The ones where the conversation is already over before it begins.

But I understand why they fight. I understand the fear.

Software development has always been about craft. We spent years learning our skills. We built careers on being able to solve hard problems. We took pride in our ability to write code that works.

Now there is a tool that can do this too. Maybe not perfectly. Maybe not always. But well enough to be scary.

When a colleague looks at my AI-assisted PR, they are not just reviewing code. They are looking at their own future. And some of them do not like what they see.

So they push back. They find problems. They request changes. They delay. They rewrite. Anything to prove that the human way is still better. That they are still needed.

This is not about my code. This is about their identity.

## The Cost We All Pay

The fighting is exhausting. But the real cost is bigger than my frustration.

When teams reject AI-assisted work, they waste time. My time writing code that gets thrown away. Their time rewriting code that already worked. Everyone's time in meetings arguing about process instead of building products.

But the worst cost is to relationships. I used to enjoy working with these people. We would grab coffee. We would joke around. We would help each other.

Now there is tension. Suspicion. Distance. They look at my commits and wonder what is really mine. I look at their feedback and wonder if it is honest or just fear talking.

We are on the same team. We have the same goals. But AI has put a wall between us.

## Building Bridges

I wish I had an easy answer. I do not. But I have learned some things that help.

First, I stopped hiding. For a while, I tried to make my AI-assisted code look like I wrote it all myself. This was a mistake. People found out anyway, and it made the trust problem worse. Now I am open about my tools. Not defensive. Not apologetic. Just honest.

Second, I started showing my work. Not just the final code. The thinking behind it. The problems I solved. The decisions I made. When people see that I understand what I submitted, they trust it more.

Third, I ask for feedback differently. Instead of "please review my PR," I try "I would love your thoughts on this approach." It sounds small. But it changes the conversation from judgment to collaboration.

Fourth, I help others learn. Some of my colleagues are curious about AI tools but afraid to try them. When I share what I have learned, when I help them experiment, we become partners instead of competitors.

Fifth, I give it time. Trust does not rebuild overnight. Every good PR, every helpful conversation, every moment of genuine collaboration adds a little bit back. It is slow. But it is working.

## The Future We Need to Build

Here is what I believe: AI is not going away. It will only get better. Teams that learn to work with AI-assisted developers will move faster than teams that fight it.

But we cannot force this change. We have to earn it.

That means being patient with colleagues who are scared. Understanding that their resistance comes from a real place. Proving through our work that AI is a tool, not a replacement.

It also means being honest about our own fears. I worry too. I wonder if my skills will matter in five years. I do not have answers. Nobody does.

What I do know is this: the wall between AI developers and traditional developers hurts everyone. We need to find a way through it. Not around it. Through it.

That starts with trust. And trust starts with understanding.

My PRs still take longer to review than others. But the gap is getting smaller. More of my colleagues are willing to engage with my work now. Some have even started using AI tools themselves.

The fight is not over. But I think we are finally starting to have a different conversation. Not "is AI code acceptable?" but "how do we work together in this new world?"

That is progress. And progress, however slow, is something I can build on.
