# A Letter to the Junior Developer of 2026

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

Dear Junior Developer,

I am writing this letter to you because I wish someone had written one to me.

You are starting your career at a strange time. You have heard the noise. AI
will replace developers. The profession is dying. Why learn to code when
machines do it better?

I hear these things too. I say some of them myself. And I will not lie to you: I
have never felt so uncertain about this profession.

But I am still here. Still coding. Still building. And I think you should be
too.

Let me tell you what I know.

## The Truth: Yes, It Is Uncertain

I will not pretend everything is fine. The profession is under a big refactor.
That is the best way I can describe it.

Some days I think: being a developer will be obsolete in two years. For sure.
The AI models keep getting better. Tasks that took me hours now take minutes.
Code that required years of experience can be generated in seconds.

Other days I think: wait, maybe not. Because the AI still needs guidance. It
still makes mistakes. It still requires someone who understands the problem.

Both thoughts are true at the same time. This is what uncertainty feels like.

So yes, junior developer, you are entering a profession that is changing fast.
Faster than any time in its history. I cannot promise you a stable path. Nobody
can.

But here is what I can promise: if you learn the right skills, you will be
valuable. Maybe more valuable than developers have ever been.

## What You Should Learn

The skills that matter in 2026 are not the same skills that mattered in 2016.

**Context engineering.** This is the new core skill. It means: how do you give
AI the right information to do its job? How do you structure a codebase so AI
can understand it? How do you write prompts that lead to good results? This is
not a small skill. It is deep work. It requires understanding both the AI and
the problem you are solving.

**Requirements.** I learned this the hard way. If an AI coding agent makes
mistakes, the requirements were not clear enough. The issue was not the AI. The
issue was that the ticket was not created properly. The requirement was not
specified well. Learning to write clear, complete requirements is now a
superpower. Most developers are bad at it. Be good at it.

**Testing.** This might surprise you. Testing sounds old-fashioned. But with AI
writing code, testing matters more than ever. How else do you know the code is
correct? How else do you catch the assumptions the AI made wrong? With the right
level of testing and process, we can develop software at incredible speed.
Without testing, that speed means nothing. You just ship bugs faster.

**Git flow and continuous delivery.** Proper version control. Small commits.
Clear history. Frequent releases. These practices seemed optional before. Now
they are essential. AI works best when it can understand the history of your
code. When it can see what changed and why. Clean git practices make AI more
effective.

## What You Should Not Fear

AI is not your replacement. AI is your tool.

I have seen developers fear AI like it is a monster coming to eat their jobs. I
understand the fear. But it is wrong.

Think of AI like this: it is the most powerful assistant you have ever had. It
can write code. It can explain code. It can find bugs. It can suggest solutions.
But it cannot understand what your users need. It cannot decide what to build.
It cannot take responsibility for the product.

Those things still require humans. They require you.

The developers who will struggle are the ones who only know how to write code.
Because yes, AI writes code very well now. But the developers who understand
problems, who talk to users, who make judgment calls about what matters - those
developers are more valuable than ever.

Do not fear the tool. Learn to use it.

## The Human Skills

Here is what AI cannot do:

**Communication.** AI cannot sit in a meeting and hear what the client is really
asking for. It cannot read the room. It cannot notice that the product manager
seems worried about something they have not said yet. You can.

**Understanding users.** AI knows code. It does not know people. It cannot watch
a user struggle with your interface and feel what they feel. It cannot have
coffee with a customer and understand their real problem. You can.

**Judgment.** AI can give you ten solutions to a problem. It cannot tell you
which one is right for your situation. It cannot weigh the tradeoffs that matter
to your team, your company, your users. You can.

**Responsibility.** When something goes wrong in production at 3am, AI does not
answer the phone. You do. When the business needs someone to own a decision, AI
cannot sign its name. You can.

These are human skills. They are hard to learn. They take years to develop. But
they are the skills that will make you irreplaceable.

## The Encouragement

I know it is hard to feel hopeful right now. The news is scary. The job market
is tough. The future is unclear.

But let me tell you what I see.

I see developers building things that matter. Using AI to move faster than ever
before. Solving problems that seemed impossible five years ago. Creating
software that helps real people live better lives.

I see a profession that is changing, yes. But not dying. Evolving.

The developers who succeed in 2026 and beyond will be different from the
developers who succeeded in 2016. They will spend less time typing code and more
time thinking about problems. They will be better communicators, better
requirement writers, better testers. They will use AI as a multiplier for their
skills, not a replacement for their brains.

You can be one of those developers. You can learn these skills. You can build
this career.

Will it be easy? No. Will it be uncertain? Yes. Will there be days when you
wonder if you made the right choice? Absolutely.

But here is what I believe: the world will always need people who can solve
problems with technology. The tools change. The skills evolve. The job titles
shift. But the core work - understanding a problem and building a solution -
that work is not going away.

You are entering a profession at a moment of transformation. That is scary. It
is also exciting. You will help define what software development becomes in the
next decade.

I cannot wait to see what you build.

Welcome to the ride.
