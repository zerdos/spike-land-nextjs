# What Do Developers Become?

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

Who am I?

This question keeps me awake at night. Not in a teenage crisis way. In a very
real, very practical way. Because I have been a developer for over a decade. And
now I am not sure that word means anything anymore.

Let me be direct with you. Being a developer will be obsolete in two years. For
sure. The profession is under a big refactor. Not a small update. Not a new
framework to learn. A complete rewrite of what we do and who we are.

This is not doom. This is not fear. This is just true.

## What We Were

Think about what developers did five years ago. We wrote code. Line by line.
Function by function. We knew languages like we knew our native tongue. We
debated tabs versus spaces. We argued about the best way to name variables.

We were translators. Business people had ideas. We translated those ideas into
instructions that machines could understand. That was the job. That was the
skill. That was what made us valuable.

We solved problems. Not just coding problems. Real problems. A company needed to
track inventory. We built a system. A hospital needed to manage patient records.
We created software. An artist wanted to sell prints online. We made it happen.

The code was the craft. The syntax was the skill. The late nights debugging were
our badge of honor.

I was proud of this. I loved it. I still love it, actually. But I have to be
honest about what has changed.

## What Is Changing

AI writes code now. Not bad code. Not simple code. Good code. Complex code. Code
that works.

I use Opus 4.5 every day. From ten tasks with proper planning, it can execute
eight or nine. That is not a typo. Eighty to ninety percent of what I used to do
manually, an AI can now do with the right context.

Think about that number. Really think about it.

When I started in this field, I spent hours writing functions. Now I describe
what I want, and it appears. When I began, debugging meant reading every line.
Now I paste an error, and the AI explains the problem. When I started, learning
a new framework took weeks. Now I ask questions and get working examples in
seconds.

The translation work is done. The machine now speaks both languages. It
understands business needs. It understands code. It does not need me in the
middle.

This is not a complaint. This is reality. And we must face it.

## What Remains Human

So what is left? If AI can write the code, what do we bring?

I have thought about this for months. Here is what I believe.

**Creativity stays human.** AI can write code that works. But it writes code
that looks like code it has seen before. It combines existing patterns. It
remixes solutions. True creativity, the kind that sees a problem nobody else
sees, that stays with us. For now.

**Judgment stays human.** Should we build this feature? Is this the right
approach? Will users actually want this? AI can give options. But the decision
of what to build, why to build it, whether to build it at all, that requires
human judgment.

**Understanding users stays human.** AI can process data about users. But
sitting with someone, watching them struggle with an interface, feeling their
frustration, that is human work. Empathy cannot be coded. Connection cannot be
computed.

**Responsibility stays human.** When the system fails, when the bug causes harm,
when the decision was wrong, someone must own that. AI cannot be responsible.
Only we can.

These things matter. They are real skills. But they are not coding skills. They
are human skills.

## The New Roles Emerging

If we are not coders anymore, what are we?

I see three paths forming.

**Orchestrator.** Someone who coordinates AI agents. Who gives them the right
tasks in the right order. Who checks their work and catches their mistakes. Like
a conductor who does not play any instrument but makes the whole orchestra work
together.

**Context Engineer.** Someone who understands that AI is only as good as the
information it receives. Who builds systems to give AI the right context. Who
creates the documentation, the examples, the constraints that make AI useful
instead of dangerous.

**Requirement Writer.** Someone who can take a vague idea and turn it into
clear, specific requirements. If coding agents make mistakes, the requirements
were not specified well enough. The issue is usually that the ticket was not
created properly. The requirement was not clear. This skill becomes the real
work.

Maybe we become all three. Maybe we specialize. Maybe new roles appear that I
cannot imagine yet.

But one thing is clear. The job is changing from writing code to enabling code
to be written.

## Finding Meaning

Here is the part that I struggle with most.

I want to be seen as a guy who really loves tech. Who is really passionate about
programming. That identity does not go away because AI writes code. If anything,
it matters more.

Because now the question is: why do you care?

If you were coding just for the paycheck, just for the job security, just
because it paid well, you will struggle. Those reasons are disappearing.

But if you code because you love solving problems, because technology excites
you, because building things brings you joy, that passion has a place. It just
looks different now.

The passion moves from writing code to shaping what code does. From syntax to
systems. From functions to futures.

I still love tech. I still get excited when something works. I still feel the
rush of solving a hard problem. But the problems I solve are different now. They
are higher level. They are more about people and less about machines.

Maybe that is okay. Maybe that is even better.

## The Real Question

Two years from now, will I still call myself a developer? I do not know.

But I know this. Whatever I become, I will still be someone who builds things
with technology. Who uses tools to solve problems. Who cares deeply about making
things work.

The title might change. The job might transform. But the passion stays.

That is what developers become. Not obsolete. Evolved. Different. Still here.
Still building. Just building in new ways.

The profession is under a big refactor. And like any refactor, it is scary and
exciting and necessary. The old code still exists somewhere. But the new version
is better. Cleaner. More focused on what actually matters.

I am ready for that. I think you are too.

We just need to figure out who we are now.
