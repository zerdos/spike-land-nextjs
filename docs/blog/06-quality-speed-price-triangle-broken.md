# Quality, Speed, Price: The Triangle AI Just Broke

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

There was a rule in software development. Everyone knew it. No one questioned it.

Quality. Speed. Price. Choose two.

This rule was law for decades. It shaped how companies made decisions. It defined how consultants priced their work. It determined what clients could expect.

Then AI came along and broke it.

## The Old Triangle

Let me explain how the triangle worked.

Want high quality and fast delivery? You pay premium rates. Senior developers. Overtime. Rush fees. Your wallet suffers.

Want high quality at a low price? You wait. The project takes months. Maybe years. The timeline stretches. Your patience suffers.

Want fast and cheap? You sacrifice quality. Junior developers. Cut corners. Technical debt. Your codebase suffers.

This was the trade-off. Always. No exceptions. Every project manager learned it. Every client heard it. Every developer lived it.

The triangle was not arbitrary. It was based on a simple truth: human time is limited and expensive. Good developers are rare. They can only work so many hours. If you want more output, you need more people or more time or more money.

The math was simple. And the math never lied.

Until now.

## The Math Changed

AI coding tools changed the equation. Not a little bit. Completely.

I work with Claude Code every day. I have seen what it can do. I have measured the difference. The productivity gain is not 2x or 5x. It is closer to 50x for certain tasks.

Let me be clear about what this means.

A feature that took a week now takes a day. A bug fix that took hours now takes minutes. A refactor that took a sprint now takes an afternoon.

And here is the part that surprises people: the quality is better too.

Why? Because I can write more tests. I can explore more edge cases. I can refactor more aggressively. I have time to do things right.

With proper testing and process, software can be developed at incredible speed with quality that was never there before. The constraint was never my skill. The constraint was time. AI removed that constraint.

Fast, cheap, AND high quality. All three. At the same time.

The triangle is broken.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Let me give you a real example.

Last month, I built a complete authentication system. OAuth integration. JWT tokens. Role-based access. Session management. Full test coverage.

In the old world, this was a two-week project. Minimum. Often a month with proper review and testing.

I did it in two days. Not by cutting corners. By moving faster than was previously possible.

The AI helped me write the code. It helped me write the tests. It helped me spot edge cases I would have missed. It helped me refactor when I found better approaches.

Every line was reviewed. Every test was meaningful. Every feature was documented.

Two days. Full quality. Minimal cost.

Another example: I refactored an entire module last week. 3,000 lines of legacy code. New patterns. New tests. Full backward compatibility.

Old timeline: two weeks of careful work. New timeline: one day of focused effort.

This is not hype. This is my daily reality.

## The Industry Impact

Now think about what this means for the software industry.

Traditional consulting models are dying. They have to be.

The old model worked like this: a consulting firm sells you hours. They estimate a project will take 1,000 hours. They charge you for 1,000 hours at $200 per hour. You pay $200,000.

But if AI makes that 1,000-hour project into a 100-hour project, what happens?

If the firm still charges for 1,000 hours, you are being cheated. If they charge for 100 hours, their revenue drops 90%.

This is an existential crisis for consulting. The entire business model is based on selling time. When time costs collapse, so does the model.

I see this already. Large agencies are struggling to justify their rates. Clients are asking harder questions. The math does not add up anymore.

Freelancers face the same challenge. If you sold yourself as "expensive but fast," what happens when cheap is also fast? If you sold yourself as "affordable but slower," what happens when fast is also affordable?

The differentiation is gone. The triangle is broken. Everyone must find new ways to compete.

## The New Competition

Here is what I think happens next.

The winners will not be the cheapest. They will not be the fastest. They will be the ones who understand problems best.

AI is incredible at writing code. It is not incredible at understanding what code should exist. It cannot talk to users. It cannot feel the pain of a broken workflow. It cannot see the business opportunity hiding in a messy process.

The human value is moving up the stack. Away from implementation. Toward understanding, strategy, and vision.

A developer who truly understands a domain will beat ten developers who just write code. Because understanding cannot be automated. Not yet.

The new competition is not about typing speed. It is about thinking speed. It is about asking the right questions. It is about solving the right problems.

## What This Means for You

If you are a client: your expectations should change. Projects that took months should take weeks. Budgets that seemed impossible are now realistic. Demand more. You can get more.

If you are a developer: your job is changing. Learn to use AI tools. Learn to use them well. But also learn to think better. The code is the easy part now. The thinking is the hard part.

If you are an agency or consultant: your business model needs work. Hourly billing is dying. Value-based pricing is the future. Show results, not timesheets.

The triangle is broken. Quality, speed, and price are all available now. At the same time.

This is not the future. This is today.

The question is: what will you do about it?
