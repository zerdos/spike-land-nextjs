## Key Memorable Quotes

### On Uncertainty

> "2026 will be such a ride - but I never felt so uncertain. The profession is under a big refactor."

> "I'm not sure that in 2026 people are still employing developers. Being a developer will be obsolete in two years, for sure."

> "Earning less than I earned five years ago. The career progression kind of stopped."

### On the Productivity Paradox

> "I became the most productive that I ever been in my life... unfortunately, at work it's not that easy."

> "If I do a PR fast, it won't even be looked at until the end of the sprint."

> "The PR won't be looked at until the end of the sprint. And last moment, they decide everything is wrong with it."

### On the "AI Slop" Confession

> "For a brief period, when I started in a new team, my PRs were pure AI slop - even with my very best effort to avoid that."

> "The AI takes assumptions on legacy codebase, and as a new developer, you have no idea what assumptions the agent made."

### On Trust & Team Dynamics

> "Everything coming from me, from AI - those PRs take 3-4x longer to review. My productivity at work because of this is really bad."

> "Colleagues would rather redo the whole PR and trash your work than feedback your PR in time - even when you asked for early feedback."

> "They are not trusting anything coming from me. If it's not working the first try... maybe not the first try but the second, the task will be done much faster."

### On the Quality Triangle Breaking

> "Previously: Quality, Speed, Price - choose two. Now with AI, all three are possible. High quality, fast, AND cheap. This is changing the industry completely."

### On Model Evolution

> "The first really good model that surprised me was Claude Sonnet 3.7"

> "Opus 4.0 - I could solve an issue that I couldn't technically solve before"

> "Opus 4.5 - from 10 tasks with proper planning, it can execute 8-9"

### On What Developers Get Wrong

> "If coding agents are making mistakes, the requirements weren't specified well enough."

> "The issue in the first place was that the ticket wasn't created properly. The requirement wasn't clear."

### On Identity & ADHD

> "I have ADHD which makes my communication style harder. I was always afraid of hearing feedback because my mind thinks you're judging me, not my work."

> "I want to be seen as a guy who really loves tech, really passionate about programming."

### On Economic Reality

> "It's borderline impossible to buy a flat if you are on payroll. You have to be a contractor. Being a contractor comes with extra uncertainty."

> "Private equity is behind everything. It feels like the economy is about to collapse."

### On What He Wants

> "I would like to work with clients that are open-minded for AI. I don't want those fights about 'it's generated with AI, there's something wrong with it.'"

> "My dream is to have my own company, be big, have an office in Brighton, nice people to work with."
