# Why I Still Code When AI Does It Better

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

People ask me this question all the time. "Zoltan, AI can write code now. Why do you still do it?"

It is a fair question. I ask myself the same thing sometimes. Especially when I watch Claude write in ten seconds what would take me an hour. Especially when the AI code is cleaner than mine. More elegant. Fewer bugs.

So why do I still code? Let me tell you.

## Yes, AI Codes Better Than Me

I am going to say something most developers will not admit. AI writes better code than I do.

There. I said it.

The AI does not get tired at 11pm. It does not forget to handle edge cases because it was thinking about dinner. It does not write messy code because it wants to finish before a meeting.

I do all those things. I am human. I make mistakes.

The AI has read more code than I ever will. It knows patterns from millions of repositories. It remembers every best practice. Every design pattern. Every way a function can fail.

I cannot compete with that. And I have stopped trying.

But here is the thing. I still code. Every single day. And I love it more than ever.

## The Craft Brings Me Joy

I am a big geek. I always have been.

When I was young, I did not dream about money or status. I dreamed about building things. Understanding how systems work. Making computers do what I wanted.

That feeling has not changed. When I solve a hard problem, something happens in my brain. A small spark. A moment of clarity. The world makes sense for a second.

No AI can give me that feeling.

I love JavaScript. I love TypeScript. I love Docker and distributed systems. I even love mathematics, which makes me strange at parties.

These are not just tools to me. They are my craft. My art. The thing I have spent years learning to do well.

When a painter uses a camera, they do not stop painting. The camera takes better pictures. But painting is not about the result. It is about the process. The brush in your hand. The colors mixing. The choices you make.

Coding is the same for me. Yes, AI gets better results. But the act of coding is where I find joy.

## AI Taught Me More Than School Ever Did

Here is something funny. AI has made me a better developer.

When I started using AI tools, I thought they would replace my learning. Why study when you can just ask?

I was wrong. So wrong.

AI became my teacher. The best teacher I ever had.

When the AI writes code, I ask why. Why this pattern? Why not another way? What happens if this fails?

The AI explains. Patiently. Without judgment. Without telling me I should already know this.

I learn things every day that would have taken me months to discover alone. Patterns I never knew existed. Edge cases I never considered. Better ways to do things I thought I understood.

AI did not replace my learning. It accelerated it. Now I understand more than ever. And understanding is where the real joy lives.

## Feeling Useful Matters More Than Being Efficient

Money is nice. I like having money. It pays for food and a warm place to live.

But money is not enough.

I need to feel useful. I need something interesting. Something challenging. A reason to wake up in the morning that is not just a paycheck.

Coding gives me that.

When I build something, I am not just generating output. I am solving problems. Real problems. Problems that matter to real people.

My project, spike.land, is my playground. It is where I experiment. Where I learn. Where I try ideas that might be stupid or might be brilliant. I usually cannot tell the difference until I build them.

This is not efficient. An AI could build spike.land faster. Better. With fewer bugs.

But spike.land is not just a product. It is my education. My laboratory. The place where I become a better developer every day.

Efficiency is overrated. Meaning is not.

## The AI Cannot Feel What I Feel

There is something the AI will never understand.

The frustration when code does not work. The late nights debugging something that should be simple. The moment when you finally find the bug and it was one missing character.

Then the joy. The relief. The pride.

These feelings are mine. The AI does not feel them. It writes code like water flows downhill. Natural. Effortless. Without emotion.

But I am not a machine. I do not want to be a machine. The struggle is part of why I code.

When I finish a hard project, I feel something. Accomplishment. Growth. The knowledge that I am better today than I was yesterday.

The AI is the same every day. It does not grow through struggle. It does not feel pride in its work.

I do. And that makes all the difference.

## Keep Coding

If you are reading this and wondering whether to keep coding, here is my answer.

Keep coding.

Not because you are better than AI. You are probably not. I am not either.

Keep coding because it makes you feel alive. Because you love the craft. Because solving problems gives you joy that no algorithm can provide.

Keep coding because you want to understand, not just produce. Because you want to feel useful, not just efficient. Because you are human and humans create.

AI is a tool. A powerful one. Use it. Learn from it. Let it make you better.

But do not let it take away your joy. Do not let efficiency kill your passion. Do not stop doing the thing you love just because a machine can do it faster.

I code because I am passionate about programming. I code because it challenges me. I code because it makes me feel useful in a world that sometimes feels overwhelming.

AI does it better. I do it anyway.

And I have never been happier.
