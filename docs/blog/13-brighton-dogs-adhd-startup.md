# Brighton, Dogs, and ADHD: Building a Startup While Everything Burns

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

It is 6:15 in the morning. My alarm goes off. The house is quiet. The dogs are
still asleep. I get dressed in the dark and head to the gym.

This is how every day starts. Not because I am a morning person. I am not. But
because I have ADHD, and without routine, my life falls apart.

Let me tell you what building a startup looks like when your brain works
differently.

## The Routine That Keeps Me Alive

My day has a rhythm. It has to.

6:30am: Gym. No thinking. Just movement. My brain wakes up slowly while my body
works. By the time I finish, my mind is ready.

8:00am: First dog walk. My two dogs need this. I need this too. We walk the same
route every day. The dogs know every corner. I know every corner. There is
comfort in sameness.

Then I work. Emails. Code. Meetings. The normal stuff.

11:00am: Second dog walk. A break from the screen. Fresh air. The dogs are
happy. I am happy.

Back to work. More code. More problems to solve.

1:00pm: Third walk. Lunch break. Sometimes I eat while walking. Sometimes I just
walk and think.

More work in the afternoon.

5:00pm: Final walk of the day. The sun is lower. The dogs are tired. I am tired
too, but in a good way.

This schedule might look boring to you. To me, it is survival.

If you have ADHD, you understand. Our brains do not make schedules for us. We
have to build them from scratch. Every single day.

The dogs help. They do not care about my deadlines. They do not know I have a
startup to build. They just know it is time for a walk. And when a dog stares at
you with those eyes, you stop what you are doing and you walk.

My body loves this routine. My brain loves it too. Structure is my medicine.

## The ADHD Reality

I need to be honest about something.

I have always been afraid of feedback.

Not because I think I am perfect. The opposite. My mind takes every piece of
criticism and turns it personal. Someone says "this code could be better" and my
brain hears "you are a failure."

I know this is not logical. I know people are talking about my work, not me. But
knowing something and feeling something are different things.

This makes working on a team hard. Code reviews feel like being judged.
Questions feel like attacks. Suggestions feel like insults.

I have to fight this every day. I have to remind myself that feedback is a gift.
That people who point out problems are trying to help. That my work is not my
worth.

ADHD makes communication harder in other ways too. I interrupt people. I forget
what I was saying mid-sentence. I hyperfocus on the wrong things. I cannot start
tasks even when they are urgent.

Building a startup with a brain like this is not easy. But it is possible.

## The Side Project Grind

I work full-time. I have a job that pays my bills. It is good work with good
people.

But in the evenings and weekends, I build Spike.land.

Spike.land is my dream. A live code editor. A platform where people can create
and share. A place where ideas become real.

Some nights I code for hours. The hyperfocus kicks in and suddenly it is 2am and
I have built something wonderful.

Other nights I cannot start. I stare at the screen. I know what I need to do. My
fingers refuse to move. My brain says "not tonight" and there is nothing I can
do.

This is the reality of building while working. Some weeks I make huge progress.
Other weeks I make none. The key is to keep going.

I have learned to forgive myself on the bad days. Tomorrow is a new day. The
code will still be there.

## Why Brighton

I live in Brighton, a city on the south coast of England.

It rains here. A lot. The wind blows off the sea. The seagulls scream at 4am.

I love it anyway.

Brighton is full of creative people. Artists. Developers. Dreamers. There is a
feeling here that anything is possible. That weird is welcome. That different is
good.

I walk my dogs along the beach. I see the old pier. I smell the salt in the air.
This is home.

My dream is simple. I want to build Spike.land into something real. I want to
have a small office here in Brighton. I want to work with nice people who
understand that brains work in different ways.

I want to wake up and go to work on my own thing. Not because I hate employment.
I do not. But because I have ideas that need to exist. And the only way to make
them exist is to build them myself.

## The Hope

Some days are hard. Really hard.

The code does not work. The feedback stings. The brain will not cooperate. The
dogs need their fourth walk and I have not finished anything.

But I keep going. Why?

Because I am really passionate about this.

I love programming. JavaScript. TypeScript. Docker. Distributed systems.
Mathematics. These things make my brain light up. When I am deep in a problem,
solving puzzles, making things work, I forget about everything else.

That feeling is worth fighting for.

And the routine helps. The gym every morning. The dog walks throughout the day.
The structure that holds everything together.

I am building something. Slowly. Imperfectly. With a brain that does not always
cooperate.

But I am building.

That is enough.
