# I Built the Perfect Developer Tool - Then Realized Nobody Could Find It

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | February 2026_

I built a vibe coding platform. It was beautiful. Claude Code integration. Live React environments. Real-time collaboration. Everything a developer could want.

And almost nobody used it.

Let me tell you what happened next.

## The Developer's Dilemma

For months I poured everything into spike.land. The vision was clear: make app development so easy that anyone could create production-ready applications just by talking to AI. Vibe coding. No setup. No deployment headaches. Just ideas becoming reality.

The tech worked. The demos were impressive. Early users loved it.

But there was a problem I did not see coming.

Nobody could find us.

I had fallen into the classic developer trap. "If you build it, they will come." That line works in movies. It does not work in app stores.

The mobile app ecosystem is brutal. You can build the best vibe coding app ever made. You can have perfect TypeScript. Beautiful UI. Zero bugs. None of it matters if you cannot get discovered.

I watched Pixel, our AI image enhancement app, sit in the app store with almost no organic downloads. Not because it was bad. Because app store visibility is driven by marketing spend, not quality.

The competitors who showed up first in searches? They had marketing teams. They had budgets. They had paid acquisition strategies.

We had none of that.

## The Marketing Wake-Up Call

I am a developer. I like solving problems with code. Marketing always felt like something other people did. Sales. Promotion. That stuff.

But reality does not care what you like.

No matter how good your developer tool is, if people cannot find it, you are doomed. This is not optional. It is not something you can skip because you are "technical, not a marketer."

Marketing is essential. Period.

I realized this the hard way. Pixel had everything going for it - AI-powered photo enhancement, 4K upscaling, instant results. But without marketing infrastructure, we were invisible.

So I made a decision. If spike.land was going to survive, I needed to solve the marketing problem. Not hire someone else to solve it. Not wait for organic growth. Actually solve it.

Like a developer solves problems.

## Building My Own Solution

I did what developers do. I built a tool.

I needed to manage marketing for Pixel. Multiple social media accounts. Content scheduling. A/B testing different messages. Analytics tracking. All the things marketing teams use expensive software for.

I looked at the existing solutions. Hootsuite. Buffer. Later. They were fine. But they were not designed for developers. And they definitely were not AI-powered.

So I built Orbit.

Orbit started as internal tooling. A way to manage Pixel's marketing without drowning in different platforms. AI-powered content generation. Multi-platform scheduling. Automated A/B testing. Everything I needed to actually market my products.

And then I realized something.

Orbit was more interesting than the vibe coding platform.

## The Pivot

Here is the thing about pivots. They are not always dramatic. Sometimes you are building one thing and you realize the side project is actually the main project.

That is what happened with Orbit.

I built it to market Pixel. But while building it, I kept thinking: this is what I actually need. This is the problem I face every day. Not "how do I code faster" - I have Claude Code for that. But "how do I get people to see what I built."

Every solo developer faces this. Every small startup. Every creator trying to build an audience.

We all have the same problem. We can build amazing things. But we cannot get them in front of people.

Marketing is not optional anymore. It is the actual blocker.

So spike.land is pivoting. From "Vibe Coding Platform" to "AI-Powered Social Media Command Center."

Orbit is now the main product. Vibe coding is still there - as a feature. Because guess what? When you are creating content for social media, sometimes you need to spin up a quick React app to generate graphics. Or run code to process data. That is where the vibe coding capability lives now.

But the core value proposition has changed.

## What's Different Now

Before, spike.land was for developers who wanted to build apps faster.

Now, spike.land is for creators who want to grow their audience faster.

Here is what that means in practice:

| Old spike.land | New spike.land |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Code without setup" | "Manage all your social accounts with AI" |
| Target: Developers | Target: Content creators, small business owners, freelance marketers |
| Core feature: Live React apps | Core feature: AI-powered content management |
| Distribution: App stores | Distribution: Direct to creators |
| Problem: Development speed | Problem: Marketing visibility |

The MCP architecture is still there. Claude Code can still call spike.land tools. But now those tools are focused on marketing workflows, not just development workflows.

Instead of:
- `codespace_update` to write code
- `generate_image` to create visuals

We now emphasize:
- `apply_brand_style` to ensure consistent voice
- `schedule_post` to manage content calendar
- `post_to_platform` to publish across channels
- `track_engagement` to measure what works

## Who It's For

Three types of people need this:

**1. Solo Content Creators**

You have an audience to build. You create content. But managing 6 different social platforms is exhausting. You want AI to help you maintain consistent presence without burning out.

That is you.

**2. Small Business Marketing Managers**

You are responsible for the company's social media. You do not have a big team. You do not have a massive budget. But you still need to post regularly, engage with followers, and show results.

That is you.

**3. Freelance Social Media Managers**

You manage multiple clients. Each client has different accounts. Different brand voices. Different content calendars. You need tools that scale across clients without chaos.

That is you.

If you are in any of those groups, spike.land is built for you now.

## The 3-Month Marketing Push

Pivoting is not just changing the website. It is changing how we talk about the product. How we reach users. How we measure success.

Here is the plan:

**Weeks 1-2: Soft Launch**

Update branding. Invite existing users to try the new features. Gather feedback. Fix obvious problems.

**Weeks 3-4: Content Marketing**

This blog post. Twitter threads. LinkedIn posts. Instagram carousels. All explaining why this pivot happened and who it helps.

**Weeks 5-6: Product Hunt Launch**

Big public launch. Top of Product Hunt for the day. Press coverage. Community engagement.

**Weeks 7-8: Paid Advertising**

Facebook ads. Instagram ads. Google ads. Targeted at the three personas above. Small budget, tight targeting, measure everything.

**Weeks 9+: Sustained Marketing**

Weekly blog posts. Case studies. Tutorial videos. Webinars. Build a content engine that keeps running.

This is not a one-time announcement. This is the beginning of spike.land actually doing marketing.

## What's Next

If you made it this far, you are probably wondering: can I try it?

Yes.

spike.land is live right now. The AI-powered social media command center is ready. You can connect your accounts, generate content with AI, schedule posts, and track what works.

If you are a solo creator trying to build an audience, this is for you.

If you are a small business trying to stay visible without a marketing team, this is for you.

If you are a freelance marketer juggling multiple clients, this is for you.

I built spike.land because I needed it. I needed a way to market Pixel that did not require a marketing degree or a massive budget. I needed AI to help me, not just write code for me.

And now it is here.

This is the pivot. From developer tool to creator platform. From vibe coding to social media command center.

The code is still there. The AI is still there. The live environments are still there.

But now they are in service of a different goal: helping you get your work in front of the people who need to see it.

Because you can build the best vibe coding app in the world. But if no one knows about it, you are doomed.

I learned that lesson. Now I am solving it.

Welcome to the new spike.land.
