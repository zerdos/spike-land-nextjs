# Earning Less Than Five Years Ago: The Developer's Economic Reality

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

I need to say something out loud. Something that feels uncomfortable to admit.

I earn less money now than I earned five years ago.

There. I said it. A software developer in 2026, with more experience, more
skills, more knowledge. And my paycheck got smaller, not bigger.

Let me tell you what happened.

## The Paycheck That Shrunk

In 2021, tech salaries were climbing. Every month, a new headline about
developer shortages. Companies fought for talent. Recruiters sent messages
daily. The money was good. The future looked bright.

I thought this was normal. I thought salaries would keep going up. I thought my
career had a clear path. More years, more experience, more money.

That is not what happened.

Somewhere around 2023, things changed. The big tech layoffs started. Then they
kept going. And going. Suddenly, the market was full of experienced developers
looking for work. The power shifted. Companies did not need to fight for us
anymore.

My salary did not go up with inflation. It went down in real terms. The career
progression kind of stopped. I am not alone in this. Many developers I know feel
the same. We just do not talk about it much.

## The Housing Trap

I live in Brighton, on the south coast of England. It is a nice city. Close to
London. Near the sea. Expensive.

I rent. I have rented for years. I would like to buy a flat someday. A small
place to call my own. Nothing fancy.

Here is the problem. It is borderline impossible to buy a flat if you are on
payroll.

The banks look at my salary. They look at house prices. They do the math. The
math does not work. I cannot borrow enough. I cannot save fast enough. Every
year, prices go up more than I can save.

People tell me to become a contractor. Contractors earn more money. Contractors
can save faster. Contractors have a chance.

But being a contractor comes with extra uncertainty. No sick pay. No holiday
pay. No job security. You trade one problem for another.

And in 2026, with the economy like this, taking on more uncertainty feels
dangerous. What if contracts dry up? What if I cannot find the next job? What if
I end up with nothing?

So I stay employed. I stay safe. I stay stuck.

## The Career Freeze

When I started as a developer, the path seemed clear. Junior, then mid-level,
then senior. Maybe lead. Maybe manager. Maybe architect. Steady growth. Regular
promotions.

That ladder broke somewhere along the way.

Companies got flatter. Middle management disappeared. The rungs got further
apart. Many senior roles vanished in layoffs. The people who kept their jobs
held on tight. Nobody moved. Nobody left. There was nowhere to go.

I am good at what I do. I keep learning new things. I ship features. I fix bugs.
I mentor others when I can.

But the promotions stopped. The raises stopped. The career progression kind of
stopped.

I am not bitter. I am just realistic. The world changed. The rules changed. What
worked ten years ago does not work now.

## The Bigger Picture

Sometimes I step back and look at everything happening around us.

Private equity is behind everything now. They buy companies. They cut costs.
They raise prices. They extract value. Then they sell. It feels like every
business I interact with follows this pattern.

The coffee shop that raised prices. The software tool that got worse. The
company that fired half its staff. Dig deep enough, and there is private equity
somewhere in the story.

I am not an economist. I am just a developer who pays attention. And what I see
makes me nervous.

It feels like the economy is about to collapse. Maybe that is too dramatic.
Maybe I am wrong. I hope I am wrong.

But when I look at the housing market, at the layoffs, at the way companies
treat workers now, I cannot shake the feeling that something is broken.
Something big.

## The AI Question

There is another thing I think about a lot.

I am not sure that in 2026 people are still employing developers the way they
used to.

AI coding tools got powerful. Very powerful. One senior developer with good AI
tools can do the work that used to need a team. Companies figured this out. They
need fewer of us.

I use these tools myself. I write about them. I believe they make me better at
my job. But I also know they make some jobs disappear.

The juniors have it worst. Nobody wants to hire entry-level developers anymore.
Why pay someone to learn when AI can help a senior do it faster? This is bad for
the whole industry. Where will the next generation of seniors come from?

I do not have answers. Just questions that keep me up at night.

## What Now

So what do I do? What can any of us do?

I keep working. I keep learning. I keep shipping code.

I try to stay valuable. Not just as someone who writes code. As someone who
understands problems. Who talks to users. Who thinks about the whole picture.

I work on my own projects. Spike.land is one of them. Not because I expect to
get rich. But because building something of my own feels like the only path that
makes sense anymore.

The startup path seems blocked by the current economy. Funding dried up.
Investors got careful. But I keep building anyway. Maybe things will change.
Maybe they will not.

I try to spend less. I lower my expectations. I find joy in small things. A walk
by the sea. A good coffee. A problem solved in code.

I talk to other developers. We share stories. We realize we are not alone. That
helps more than you might think.

## The Honest Truth

I used to believe that hard work guaranteed success. That skills led to money.
That the future was bright if you just kept improving.

I do not believe that anymore. Not fully.

Hard work matters. Skills matter. But luck matters too. Timing matters. Forces
beyond our control matter a lot.

I am earning less than five years ago. My career progression stopped. I cannot
buy a home. The economy feels fragile.

This is my reality. Maybe it is yours too.

I am not giving up. I still code every day. I still love what I do. I still
think technology can make the world better.

But I am done pretending everything is fine. It is not fine. And saying that out
loud is the first step to figuring out what comes next.
