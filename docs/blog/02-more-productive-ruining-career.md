# I'm More Productive Than Ever and It's Ruining My Career

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

I have become the most productive developer I have ever been in my life.

This should be good news. It is not.

Let me explain the strange problem I face every day.

## The Discovery

A few months ago, I started using Claude Code with Opus 4.5. If you have not tried it, let me be clear: this is not autocomplete. This is not a fancy search engine. This is something new.

I can do tasks fifty times faster than before. Not a small improvement. Fifty times. A feature that took me a full day now takes me thirty minutes. A bug that needed hours of searching now gets fixed in minutes.

At first, I felt like I had superpowers. I was shipping code faster than ever. My ticket count was impressive. My output looked amazing on paper.

I thought this would help my career. I was wrong.

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

Here is what happens in real life.

I finish a feature. I create a pull request. I feel good. The code is clean. The tests pass. Everything works.

Then I wait.

And wait.

And wait.

The PR sits there. Nobody looks at it. Days pass. Sometimes a full week passes. The sprint ends. Only then does someone finally review my work.

And when they do? They decide everything is wrong with it.

Not because the code is bad. Not because there are bugs. But because the process was not designed for this speed.

## The Friction

I learned something painful: if I do a PR fast, it will not be looked at until the end of the sprint.

Think about that. The faster I work, the longer my code sits unreviewed. The longer it sits, the more the codebase changes around it. The more it changes, the more conflicts appear. The more conflicts, the more rework I need to do.

Speed became a punishment.

But there is something worse. Everything coming from me now takes three to four times longer to review. Why? Because the team does not trust AI-generated code.

They look at my PRs differently. They search for problems that might not exist. They question decisions that make perfect sense. They spend extra time checking for "AI mistakes" even when there are none.

My productivity at work has become really bad. Not because I cannot code. Because the system cannot absorb what I produce.

## The Deeper Problem

I realized something important. Our entire sprint process was designed for human-speed development.

Two-week sprints made sense when a feature took a week to build. Code reviews at the end of the sprint made sense when there were only a few PRs to review.

But when one developer can produce the work of five? The system breaks.

It is like trying to drink from a fire hose. The team cannot process the volume. So they slow everything down. They create friction. They make rules that limit output instead of improving throughput.

I do not blame them. They are doing their best with a system designed for a different world. But that does not make it less frustrating.

## The Real Cost

Here is what hurts most. I have this incredible tool. I can build things I never could before. I can solve problems faster than ever. I can learn and adapt at amazing speed.

But I cannot use it.

Every day, I hold back. I work slower than I could. I submit fewer PRs than I could. I wait for others to catch up.

I feel like I have a sports car but I am stuck in traffic. The engine roars. The potential is there. But I cannot move.

Some days I wonder: am I hurting my career by being too good? Is my productivity actually a liability? Should I just slow down and fit in?

These are strange questions. They should not exist. But they do.

## What Needs to Change

I do not have all the answers. But I know some things need to be different.

**First, code review needs to change.** We cannot batch reviews at the end of sprints anymore. When code can be written in hours, it should be reviewed in hours. Not days.

**Second, teams need to accept AI-assisted development.** Treating AI code with extra suspicion wastes time. The code either works or it does not. Judge the output, not the tool.

**Third, sprints might need to die.** Or at least evolve. A two-week cycle made sense for human-speed work. For AI-speed work, we need something more fluid. Daily deployments. Continuous review. Faster feedback loops.

**Fourth, organizations need to redesign workflows.** Not just tolerate faster developers. Actually build systems that can handle higher throughput. This is a leadership problem, not a developer problem.

**Fifth, we need honest conversations.** About what AI means for teams. About how to measure value. About what "productivity" really means in 2026.

## Where I Am Now

I still use AI every day. I still produce more than I ever did. But I have also learned to navigate the friction.

Some days I focus on the big wins. Other days I play the game. I time my PRs for when reviewers are available. I break work into smaller chunks that are easier to digest. I document everything so reviews go faster.

It works. Mostly.

But I know this is not sustainable. The gap between what I can do and what the system allows will only grow. AI tools will get better. The friction will get worse.

Something has to give.

I hope teams and leaders read this. I hope they understand that their best developers might be trapped. Not by lack of skill. Not by lack of tools. But by processes that cannot keep up.

The future of work is here. The question is whether our workplaces are ready for it.

I am more productive than ever. And right now, it is ruining my career.

But I am not giving up. The world will catch up eventually. Until then, I will keep pushing. Keep building. Keep hoping.

Because the alternative is to slow down. And I refuse to do that.
