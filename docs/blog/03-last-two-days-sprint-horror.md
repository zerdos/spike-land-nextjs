# The Last Two Days of Every Sprint: A Horror Story

_By Zoltan Erdos | Brighton, UK | January 2026_

Picture this. It is Thursday. The sprint ends on Friday.

My Slack is exploding. Every message is urgent. Every comment is red. Every conversation starts with "we need to talk about your PR."

I have three pull requests open. I submitted them eight days ago. For eight days, nothing. Silence. No comments. No questions. No feedback.

Now, with 36 hours left, everyone has opinions. Strong opinions. Everything is wrong. Everything must change. Everything is on fire.

This is not unusual. This is every sprint. This is my life.

## The Pattern

Let me walk you through a typical two-week sprint.

Day one. The sprint starts. We have planning meetings. We pick tickets. I am excited. I start working.

Day two. I finish my first ticket. The code is clean. The tests pass. I open a pull request. I tag my reviewers. I write a nice description. I move on to the next task.

Day three. No comments on my PR. That is fine. People are busy. I finish another ticket. Another PR.

Day four. Still nothing. I send a message. "Hey, when you have time, could you look at my PR?" Someone says "sure, will do." I believe them. I should not.

Day five. Week one is over. I have three PRs open. Zero feedback. I start feeling nervous.

Day six. Sprint midpoint. I ask again. "Any blockers on those PRs? I want to fix issues early." Someone says "looks fine from what I can see." That is not a review. That is a pat on the head.

Day seven. Day eight. Day nine. Silence. My PRs sit there. Waiting. Growing stale. The codebase is changing around them. Conflicts are forming. But nobody tells me anything.

Day ten. Two days left. I ask one more time. "Please review my PRs so I can fix things." I get no response.

And then it happens.

## The Explosion

Thursday morning. Eight hours until the sprint review. Suddenly, everyone cares.

The comments start flowing. Not one or two. Dozens. On every PR.

"This pattern does not match our standards."

"You should use this approach instead."

"This whole section needs to be rewritten."

"Why did you do it this way?"

I stare at my screen. Eight days. They had eight days to tell me this. Instead, I learn everything is wrong when it is almost too late to fix it.

I start responding. Fixing. Rewriting. But every fix creates new questions. Every change needs another review. The reviewers are busy with their own last-minute rush.

The clock is ticking. I am sweating. My coffee goes cold. My dogs wonder why I am not taking them for a walk.

By midnight, I am still working. Fixing things that could have been fixed days ago. Answering questions that could have been asked last week. Rewriting code that was fine until someone decided it was not.

## The Feedback Vacuum

Here is what makes this so painful. I ask for feedback early. I beg for it. I want to know if I am on the wrong path before I walk ten miles.

But the feedback never comes.

Why? I do not fully understand. Maybe people are too busy with their own work. Maybe reviewing is boring. Maybe they assume someone else will do it.

Or maybe there is something else. Maybe they do not trust my code because I use AI tools. Maybe they think everything I write is "AI slop" and needs extra checking. Maybe they put off reviewing my work because it feels like more effort.

I wrote about this before. When you use AI tools, some teams look at your code differently. They check harder. They question more. That is fair. AI makes mistakes.

But that extra checking takes time. And if they do not start until the last two days, that time does not exist.

## The Human Cost

Let me tell you what this does to a person.

First, there is the stress. Those last two days are brutal. High pressure. No sleep. Constant anxiety. Every notification makes my heart jump.

Second, there is the waste. I spend hours rewriting code that was already done. If I had gotten feedback on day four, the fix would take twenty minutes. On day twelve, it takes four hours. The codebase has changed. My context has faded. Everything is harder.

Third, there is the frustration. I feel like my time does not matter. My work sits ignored until the last moment. Then it gets torn apart when there is no time to discuss properly.

Fourth, there is something worse. Sometimes my colleagues would rather redo my entire PR themselves than give me feedback in time. They trash my work and rewrite it. Because that is faster than the back-and-forth. Because they do not trust that I will fix it right.

That hurts. That really hurts. I put effort into that code. I thought about it. I tested it. And instead of helping me make it better, they throw it away.

## What Should Change

I have thought about this a lot. Here is what I believe needs to happen.

**Review early.** Not at the end of the sprint. Not when everything is urgent. On day two. On day three. When there is still time to fix things properly.

**Give partial feedback.** You do not need to review everything at once. Leave one comment. Point out one issue. Start the conversation. Something is better than nothing.

**Trust the process.** If you ask me to change something, trust that I will try to do it well. Do not rewrite my code without giving me a chance.

**Make reviewing a priority.** Code review should not be the thing you do after your "real work." It is real work. It is how teams build quality software together.

**Talk about the pattern.** If every sprint ends in chaos, that is not bad luck. That is a broken process. Name it. Discuss it. Fix it.

I know changing team habits is hard. I know everyone is busy. I know reviewing code is not exciting.

But those last two days should not be a horror story. They should not be the time when everything explodes.

They should be calm. They should be about polishing, not panicking. They should be about celebrating done work, not destroying it.

Until teams change how they review, those last two days will keep being a nightmare. Sprint after sprint. Rewrite after rewrite.

And developers like me will keep asking for feedback that never comes.
