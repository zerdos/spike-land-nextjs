# Launch Plan - Spike Land Platform

**Target Launch Date:** TBD (Recommended: Q1 2026)
**Platform:** https://spike.land
**Version:** 1.0.0

This document outlines the comprehensive launch strategy, timeline, monitoring plan, rollback procedures, and support escalation paths for the Spike Land platform.

---

## 🎯 Launch Strategy

### Launch Approach: Phased Rollout

We recommend a **phased rollout** strategy to minimize risk and ensure platform stability:

1. **Private Beta** (T-14 to T-7): Internal testing with team and invited users
2. **Public Beta** (T-7 to T-1): Limited public access with invitation codes
3. **Soft Launch** (T-Day): Full public access with minimal marketing
4. **Full Launch** (T+7): Full marketing push and public announcement

### Launch Goals

#### Primary Goals
- Achieve 99.9% uptime in first 30 days
- Process 100+ image enhancements without critical failures
- Onboard 50+ users successfully
- Zero critical security incidents

#### Secondary Goals
- Average API response time < 500ms (p95)
- Image enhancement success rate > 95%
- User retention > 60% (returning within 7 days)
- Positive user feedback (NPS > 40)

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data integrity issue detected (data loss or corruption)
- Complete service outage > 15 minutes
- Error rate > 50% for > 5 minutes
- Payment processing failures affecting users

**Evaluate Rollback:**
- Error rate > 10% for > 15 minutes
- Enhancement failure rate > 50%
- Significant performance degradation
- Multiple critical bugs reported

### Rollback Process

#### Emergency Rollback (< 5 Minutes)

**Option 1: Revert to Previous Deployment (Fastest)**

```bash
# Via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/[org]/spike-land-nextjs/deployments
2. Find last stable deployment (before current)
3. Click "..." menu → "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm rollback
5. Verify production URL loads successfully
```

**Option 2: Rollback via CLI**

```bash
# Via Vercel CLI
vercel rollback
# Follow prompts to select previous deployment
```

#### Database Rollback (If Needed)

**WARNING:** Only if migration caused the issue

```bash
# Step 1: Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Step 2: Check migration history
SELECT * FROM _prisma_migrations ORDER BY finished_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Step 3: Rollback migration (create reverse migration)
# This is manual - requires understanding of schema changes

# Step 4: Apply reverse migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Step 5: Verify database state
```

**IMPORTANT:** Database rollbacks are risky. Prefer rolling forward with fixes.

### Post-Rollback Actions

**Immediately After Rollback:**
1. [ ] Verify production is stable
2. [ ] Notify team in Slack
3. [ ] Post status update (if public-facing)
4. [ ] Begin incident post-mortem

**Within 1 Hour:**

2. [ ] Identify root cause
3. [ ] Create hotfix plan
4. [ ] Test hotfix in staging

**Within 4 Hours:**
1. [ ] Deploy tested hotfix
2. [ ] Verify fix resolves issue
3. [ ] Complete incident report
4. [ ] Update documentation

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Error Rate | Affected Users | Action | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------|----------|
| Critical | > 50% | All | Immediate rollback | < 5 min |
| High | > 25% | > 50% | Evaluate → Likely rollback | < 15 min |
| Medium | > 10% | > 25% | Investigate → Fix forward if possible | < 1 hour |
| Low | > 5% | < 10% | Fix forward | < 4 hours |
