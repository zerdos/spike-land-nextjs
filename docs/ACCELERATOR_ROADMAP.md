## Strategy: Pre-Launch Solo Founder

### Your Competitive Advantage

**Technical Achievement Story:**

- Built a full-stack AI SaaS platform as a solo founder
- Used AI-assisted development workflows to move at 5-10x speed
- Production-ready infrastructure before any marketing spend
- This proves you can ship - now you need resources to scale

### Narrative to Use in Applications

> "I built Orbit as a solo founder using AI-assisted development. In 2 months, I shipped what typically requires a team of 5-10 engineers: a production-ready social media management platform with AI-powered inbox triage, competitive intelligence, brand voice training, and content generation.
>
> The product is live, tested, and ready for users. What I need now is cloud infrastructure to scale (AI inference is expensive) and go-to-market support. This is the perfect time for accelerator involvement - the hard technical work is done, and I need help with distribution."

### Key Points to Highlight

| Point                 | Evidence                             | Why It Matters              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Technical execution   | Full-featured platform live          | Can ship without large team |
| AI-native development | Solo founder = team output           | Efficient use of resources  |
| Production quality    | 99.9% uptime infrastructure          | Ready to scale              |
| Clear market          | $20B+ social media management market | Large TAM                   |
| Revenue model         | SaaS tiers at $29-99/month           | Proven business model       |
| UK company            | Registered Ltd company               | Legitimate entity           |

### What You Need from Accelerators

1. **Cloud Credits** (Primary)
   - AI inference costs are the main scaling bottleneck
   - Image enhancement, content generation, sentiment analysis
   - $100-350K in credits enables growth without burning cash

2. **Go-to-Market Support** (Secondary)
   - Marketing expertise and distribution channels
   - First customer introductions
   - Content marketing and SEO guidance

3. **Network Effects** (Tertiary)
   - Alumni network for partnerships
   - Investor introductions when ready
   - Credibility signal for enterprise customers
