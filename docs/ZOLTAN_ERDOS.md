## Professional Summary

Passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer with 12+ years of experience and a
strong focus on frontend development backed by substantial backend expertise.
Proven track record of producing high-quality code, advocating for Test-Driven
Development (TDD), and staying current with the latest tech trends.

**Key differentiators:**

- **AI-driven development pioneer** - Utilizing AI tools to achieve what was
  previously impossible: high quality, fast delivery, AND low cost
- **TDD advocate** - Strong believer in testing as the foundation of quality
- **Solo founder** - Proving that one person with the right tools and processes
  can build enterprise-grade software

---

## Technical Philosophy

> "With AI, the impossible triangle is broken - high quality, fast delivery, AND
> low cost are now achievable together."

### Core Beliefs

1. **Testing First** - Unit tests, E2E tests, and proper test coverage are
   non-negotiable. When you have merge conflicts, tests reveal errors that
   humans miss.

2. **CI/CD is Essential** - Continuous delivery removes the burden of manual
   deployment and ensures every change is validated.

3. **AI-Assisted Workflows** - With proper planning, AI can execute complex
   tasks. From 10 tasks, Claude Opus 4.5 can complete 9 correctly with proper
   context.

4. **Zero Technical Debt** - With AI assistance, refactoring is no longer a
   "someday" task. The codebase can maintain the highest standards continuously.

5. **GitOps Everything** - GitHub issues become features. A comment asking
   Claude to fix something results in a PR with full tests in 30 minutes.

What began as a learning tool evolved into a full AI-powered development
platform:

- **2020**: Initial concept - browser-based code editor
- **2021-2023**: Refinement of in-browser build process
- **2024**: AI integration becomes central
- **2025**: Full GitOps workflow - GitHub issues to PRs automatically

### Current State

> it."

- Image generation and modification via MCP servers
- Bulk AI operations for users and agents
- Any AI-related workflow, eventually

### Vision

Spike Land is most useful for:

- **AI agents** extending their capabilities
- **People** who want to extend AI agent capabilities
- **Anyone** with an app idea who can describe it and see it built

## Personal Side

### Daily Routine

Consistency is key. Every day follows the same pattern:

| Time      | Activity                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 6:30 AM   | Gym opens - cardio every single day      |
| 8:00-9:00 | Dog park with Pixel (and second dog)     |
| 9:00-9:30 | House chores, cleanup                    |
| 9:30 AM   | Start work - open laptop, check messages |
| 11:00 AM  | Roof terrace break with dogs             |
| 1:00-2:00 | Lunch break walk                         |
| 2:00-5:00 | Afternoon work                           |
| 5:00-6:00 | Evening walk                             |
| Evening   | Dinner, roof terrace, relaxation         |

> "If you have a daily routine that's the same every single day, dogs love it.
> Your body loves it. You sleep better."

### The Dogs

- **Pixel** - The original companion, namesake of the photo app
- **Second dog** - New addition to the family

### Self-Improvement Journey

**ADHD & Communication**

Living with ADHD has presented challenges, particularly around receiving
feedback. The instinct was to perceive feedback as personal judgment rather than
professional input.

Content creation became a practice ground:

- Recording audio on dog walks
- Turning recordings into blog posts
- Building communication skills through practice
- Learning to separate work from self-worth

**Wellness Practices**

- Daily cardio for mental clarity
- Meditation
- Sports and physical activity
- Consistent routine for stability

### Philosophy

> "If you love what you do and are surrounded by nice and loving dogs, you are
> fine. You can do everything."

**On money:**

> "Money is super nice to have, of course. But with more money, you won't be
> more happy. You need to feel useful. You need something interesting, something
> challenging."

## Dreams & Vision

### The Brighton Office Dream

The ultimate goal: a company with an office in Brighton, filled with nice people
who share the vision.

### Working With the Right People

**Ideal collaborators:**

- Open-minded about AI
- Not afraid of breaking things
- Trust iteration and quick fixes
- Value testing and technical excellence
- Focus on delivery over process

**Not a fit:**

- Resistant to new approaches
- Excessive process over outcomes
- Distrust of AI-generated code
- Finding excuses instead of solutions

### Proving the Model

> "I want to prove that with the right level of testing and process, we can
> develop software at incredible speed with quality that was never there
> before."

The goal is to demonstrate that solo developers, armed with AI tools and proper
engineering practices, can compete with and outperform traditional teams.
