## Understanding Tokens

### What Are Tokens?

Tokens are Spike Land's platform currency. When you create a Spike Land account,
you get a token balance that can be spent across any app on the platform. Think
of tokens like credits that work everywhere on Spike Land.

Currently, the Pixel image enhancement app uses tokens to pay for AI-powered
image enhancements. As more apps are added to the platform, your same token
balance will work with all of them.

### Token Sources

You can get tokens through four methods:

#### 1. Free Automatic Regeneration

Get 1 free token every 15 minutes, up to a maximum of 100 tokens.

**How it works:**

- Tokens generate automatically while you sleep, work, or are away
- You never need to do anything - it's passive
- Perfect for casual users who enhance 1-2 images per day
- Maximum balance: 100 free tokens

**Example Timeline:**

- Start with 0 tokens
- After 15 minutes: 1 token
- After 2 hours: 8 tokens
- After 25 hours: 100 tokens (capped)

#### 2. Promotional Vouchers

Redeem voucher codes for bonus tokens.

**Current Vouchers:**

| Code      | Tokens | Usage               | Link               |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| WELCOME50 | 50     | Unlimited           | Share with friends |
| LAUNCH100 | 100    | Limited (1000 uses) | New user special   |
| BETA25    | 25     | Limited (500 uses)  | Beta testers only  |

**How to Redeem:**

1. Go to Settings → Tokens → Redeem Voucher
2. Enter voucher code
3. Click "Redeem"
4. Tokens added instantly

**Important**: You can redeem multiple vouchers (one per code), but cannot
redeem the same code twice.

#### 3. Stripe One-Time Purchases

Buy tokens directly with your credit or debit card.

**Token Packages:**

| Package           | Tokens | Price  | Per Token | Best For            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| Starter Pack      | 50     | £2.99  | 6p        | Try it out          |
| Essential Pack    | 150    | £7.99  | 5p        | Monthly user        |
| Professional Pack | 500    | £19.99 | 4p        | Heavy usage         |
| Enterprise Pack   | 2000   | £59.99 | 3p        | Teams/organizations |

**How to Purchase:**

1. Go to Settings → Tokens → Buy Tokens
2. Select a package
3. Click "Purchase"
4. Complete Stripe checkout
5. Tokens credited instantly

**Important**: Purchased tokens never expire and combine with your free token
balance.

#### 4. Subscription Plans

Subscribe for automatic monthly token allocation.

**Available Plans:**

| Plan         | Tokens/Month | Price/Month | Best For      | Rollover |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Starter      | 20           | £2.99       | Casual users  | 20 max   |
| Professional | 100          | £9.99       | Regular users | 100 max  |
| Enterprise   | 500          | £29.99      | Power users   | 250 max  |

**How Subscriptions Work:**

1. **Sign Up**: Go to Settings → Tokens → Subscribe
2. **Monthly Renewal**: Charged automatically each month
3. **Token Allocation**: Tokens added on your renewal date
4. **Rollover**: Unused tokens carry to next month (up to limit)
5. **Management**: Pause, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime

**Subscription Example** (Professional Plan, 100 tokens/month):

- Month 1: Allocated 100, used 60, rollover 40
- Month 2: Allocated 100 + rollover 40 = 140 (capped at 100)
- Month 3: New allocation, previous unused tokens still available

**Pause Subscription**: No charge during pause, no tokens added **Cancel
Anytime**: Keep remaining tokens forever

### Token Costs (Pixel App)

When you enhance an image in Pixel, the cost depends on the quality tier you
choose:

| Tier    | Max Resolution | Cost      | Use Case                        |
| ------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| TIER_1K | 1024px         | 2 tokens  | Quick preview, social media     |
| TIER_2K | 2048px         | 5 tokens  | Professional use, print preview |
| TIER_4K | 4096px         | 10 tokens | High-res print, archival        |

**Token Calculation Examples:**

- **With 50-token Starter Pack**:
  - TIER_1K: 25 enhancements
  - TIER_2K: 10 enhancements
  - TIER_4K: 5 enhancements

- **With Professional Subscription (100/month)**:
  - TIER_2K: 20 enhancements per month
  - Mixed usage: Could stretch to 40+ with TIER_1K

### Monitoring Your Token Balance

Your token balance is always visible in the header (top right corner). It shows:

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues

**"File too large" error**

- Solution: Maximum 25 MB per file. Compress or resize your image.

**"Unsupported format" error**

- Solution: Use JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, or BMP format.

**Upload takes forever**

- Solution: Check your internet speed. Try a smaller file first.

### Enhancement Issues

**"Insufficient tokens" error**

- Solution: You don't have enough tokens. Options:
  1. Wait for free token regeneration (1 per 15 min)
  2. Redeem a voucher code
  3. Purchase tokens via Stripe
  4. Subscribe to a plan

**Enhancement fails after processing**

- Solution: Tokens are refunded automatically. Causes:
  - File too large for tier (reduce TIER_4K for large images)
  - Temporary server issue (try again)
  - Rate limit exceeded (wait before retrying)

**Long processing time (> 60 seconds)**

- Solution: This is unusual. Reasons:
  - Server load spike (be patient, it should complete)
  - API rate limit hit (retry after waiting)
  - Network timeout (refresh and check status)

- Refresh page to reload balance
- Recent purchases take a few seconds
- Check transaction history for details

**Didn't receive confirmation email**

- Check spam/junk folder
- Resend from sign-up page
- Try different email address if persistent

### Payment Issues
