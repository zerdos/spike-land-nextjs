## Understanding Tokens

### What Are Tokens?

Tokens are Spike Land's platform currency. When you create a Spike Land account,
you get a token balance that can be spent across any app on the platform. Think
of tokens like credits that work everywhere on Spike Land.

Currently, the Pixel image enhancement app uses tokens to pay for AI-powered
image enhancements. As more apps are added to the platform, your same token
balance will work with all of them.

### Token Sources

You can get tokens through four methods:

#### 1. Free Automatic Regeneration

Get 1 free token every 15 minutes, up to a maximum of 100 tokens.

**How it works:**

- Tokens generate automatically while you sleep, work, or are away
- You never need to do anything - it's passive
- Perfect for casual users who enhance 1-2 images per day
- Maximum balance: 100 free tokens

**Example Timeline:**

- Start with 0 tokens
- After 15 minutes: 1 token
- After 2 hours: 8 tokens
- After 25 hours: 100 tokens (capped)

#### 2. Promotional Vouchers

Redeem voucher codes for bonus tokens.

**Current Vouchers:**

| Code      | Tokens | Usage               | Link               |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| WELCOME50 | 50     | Unlimited           | Share with friends |
| LAUNCH100 | 100    | Limited (1000 uses) | New user special   |
| BETA25    | 25     | Limited (500 uses)  | Beta testers only  |

**How to Redeem:**

1. Go to Settings → Tokens → Redeem Voucher
2. Enter voucher code
3. Click "Redeem"
4. Tokens added instantly

**Important**: You can redeem multiple vouchers (one per code), but cannot
redeem the same code twice.

#### 3. Stripe One-Time Purchases

**Subscription Example** (Professional Plan, 100 tokens/month):

- Month 1: Allocated 100, used 60, rollover 40
- Month 2: Allocated 100 + rollover 40 = 140 (capped at 100)
- Month 3: New allocation, previous unused tokens still available

**Pause Subscription**: No charge during pause, no tokens added **Cancel
Anytime**: Keep remaining tokens forever

### Token Costs (Pixel App)

When you enhance an image in Pixel, the cost depends on the quality tier you
choose:

| Tier    | Max Resolution | Cost      | Use Case                        |
| ------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| FREE    | 1024px         | 0 tokens  | Testing, previews (nano model)  |
| TIER_1K | 1024px         | 2 tokens  | Quick enhancement, social media |
| TIER_2K | 2048px         | 5 tokens  | Professional use, print preview |
| TIER_4K | 4096px         | 10 tokens | High-res print, archival        |

**Important Notes:**

- **FREE tier** uses a faster but lower-quality "nano" AI model - perfect for
  testing
- **TIER_1K/2K/4K** use the full Google Gemini AI model for best results
- All tiers use the same 4-stage enhancement pipeline (Analysis → Auto-Crop →
  Prompting → Generation)

**Token Calculation Examples:**

## Image Enhancement

### Understanding Enhancement Tiers

Pixel offers four quality tiers to balance quality, speed, and cost:

#### FREE Tier (0 tokens)

**Maximum Output**: 1024px on longest side **AI Model**: Nano (faster, lower
quality)

**Best For:**

- Testing the enhancement pipeline
- Quick previews before committing tokens
- Experimenting with different images

**Limitations:**

- Lower quality than paid tiers
- Uses a simpler AI model
- Good for testing, not final output

#### TIER_1K (2 tokens)

**Maximum Output**: 1024px on longest side **AI Model**: Full Google Gemini

**Best For:**

- Social media posts (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook)
- Web thumbnails and avatars
- Quick enhancements on a budget
- Images that will be viewed on screens

**Example:**

- Original: 1920x1440 photo
- Enhanced: 1024x768 (maintains aspect ratio)

#### TIER_2K (5 tokens)

**Maximum Output**: 2048px on longest side **AI Model**: Full Google Gemini

**Best For:**

- Professional use and portfolios
- Print preview (up to 8x10 inches at 300 DPI)
- High-quality web display
- Most common choice for general use

**Example:**

- Original: 1920x1440 photo
- Enhanced: 2048x1536 (upscaled 1.07x)

#### TIER_4K (10 tokens)

**Maximum Output**: 4096px on longest side **AI Model**: Full Google Gemini

**Best For:**

- High-resolution printing
- Professional photography
- Archival quality preservation
- Large format displays

**Example:**

- Original: 1920x1440 photo
- Enhanced: 4096x3072 (upscaled 2.13x)

### The 4-Stage Enhancement Pipeline

Every enhancement goes through four intelligent stages:

**Stage 1: Analysis**

- AI analyzes the image to detect defects
- Identifies issues like darkness, blur, noise, low resolution
- Detects problems like VHS artifacts, color cast, overexposure
- Analysis takes 2-5 seconds

**Stage 2: Auto-Crop**

- Automatically removes unwanted elements
- Crops black bars (letterbox/pillarbox)
- Removes UI elements, watermarks, overlays
- Only crops if improvement is significant (configurable minimum: 5%)

**Stage 3: Smart Prompting**

- Builds a dynamic enhancement prompt
- Combines defect corrections with custom instructions
- Adapts to the image's specific needs
- Allows selective skipping of certain corrections

**Stage 4: Generation**

- Calls Google Gemini AI to generate enhanced image
- Uses the smart prompt from Stage 3
- Automatically retries on failure (up to 3 times by default)
- Returns the enhanced image

### How to Enhance an Image

**From Album View:**

1. Open an album containing uploaded images
2. Find the image you want to enhance
3. Click on the image card
4. In the image detail view, select your quality tier
5. Click **"Enhance"** button
6. Watch the progress through the 4 stages
7. View the before/after comparison when complete

**Batch Enhancement:**

1. In album view, enter selection mode (checkbox icon)
2. Select multiple images
3. Click **"Enhance Selected"**
4. Choose the quality tier
5. All selected images are enhanced using the same pipeline
6. Track progress for each image

### Enhancement Progress

During enhancement, you'll see real-time status:

- **Analyzing...** - AI is analyzing the image (Stage 1)
- **Cropping...** - Auto-crop is being applied (Stage 2)
- **Prompting...** - Enhancement prompt is being generated (Stage 3)
- **Generating...** - Gemini AI is creating the enhanced image (Stage 4)

Typical processing time: **10-45 seconds** depending on tier and server load

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with FREE tier**: Test enhancement before spending tokens
2. **Choose appropriate tier**: Don't overpay for resolution you don't need
3. **Original quality matters**: Higher quality originals produce better
   enhancements
4. **Aspect ratio preserved**: Original aspect ratio is always maintained
5. **Use custom pipelines**: Configure enhancement behavior for specific use
   cases
6. **Batch similar images**: Enhance similar photos together for consistency

### What the AI Enhances

The enhancement process improves:

- **Resolution**: Upscales to your chosen tier
- **Sharpness**: Improves detail and clarity
- **Noise Reduction**: Removes digital noise and grain
- **Color Correction**: Fixes color cast and exposure issues
- **Defect Removal**: Addresses blur, artifacts, and distortion
- **Overall Quality**: General enhancement while preserving character

### Enhancement Failures and Refunds

If an enhancement fails:

- **Automatic token refund**: Tokens are immediately returned to your balance
- **No penalty**: You can retry immediately at no additional cost
- **Error message**: Shows why the enhancement failed
- **Retry options**: Try again with same or different settings
- **Support available**: Contact support if failures persist

Common failure reasons:

- API rate limits (temporary)
- Invalid image format
- File too large for tier
- Network timeout
- Server overload

---

## Enhancement Pipelines

### What are Pipelines?

Pipelines are reusable AI enhancement configurations that control how images are
processed through the 4-stage enhancement workflow. Think of them as presets or
recipes for different enhancement scenarios.

**Why Use Pipelines?**

- **Customize behavior**: Control exactly how the AI enhances images
- **Reuse configurations**: Save settings for different use cases
- **Share with others**: Public pipelines can be used by anyone
- **Fork and modify**: Copy existing pipelines and customize them

### Accessing Pipelines

1. From the Pixel app homepage, click **"Pipelines"** button in the header
2. Or navigate directly to `/apps/pixel/pipelines`
3. You'll see:
   - **System Default Pipelines**: Pre-configured by Spike Land
   - **Your Pipelines**: Pipelines you've created
   - **Public Pipelines**: Shared by other users (future feature)

### Creating a Custom Pipeline

1. Click **"New Pipeline"** button
2. Configure each of the 4 stages (see configuration options below)
3. Set basic information:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Portrait Enhancement")
   - **Description**: What this pipeline optimizes for
   - **Default Tier**: TIER_1K, TIER_2K, or TIER_4K
   - **Visibility**: Private, Public, or Unlisted
4. Click **"Save"**

### Pipeline Configuration

  - Use higher values (0.5-0.8) for more creative analysis

**What Gets Analyzed:**

- Darkness (underexposure)
- Blur (motion or focus issues)
- Noise and grain
- VHS/tape artifacts
- Low resolution
- Overexposure
- Color cast

#### Stage 2: Auto-Crop Configuration

Automatically removes unwanted elements.

**Settings:**

- **Enable Auto-Crop** (toggle): Turn auto-crop on/off
- **Remove Black Bars** (toggle): Crop letterbox/pillarbox bars
- **Remove UI Elements** (toggle): Crop overlays, watermarks, HUD
- **Minimum Crop Ratio** (1-20%): Only crop if removing at least this much
  - Default: 5%
  - Higher values = more conservative cropping

#### Stage 3: Prompt Configuration

Controls the dynamic prompt generation.

**Settings:**

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is Spike Land free to use?** A: Yes! Spike Land is free to sign up and use.
Your account automatically generates 1 free token every 15 minutes (up to 100
tokens maximum). You can use the FREE tier (0 tokens) for unlimited
enhancements, or use tokens for higher quality tiers. Additional tokens can be
purchased, earned through referrals, or redeemed via vouchers.

**Q: How long does image enhancement take?** A: Most enhancements complete in
10-45 seconds depending on the quality tier and server load. The process goes
through 4 stages: Analysis (2-5s), Auto-Crop (1-3s), Prompting (1-2s), and
Generation (10-35s).

**Q: What image formats do you support?** A: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP.
Maximum file size is 25 MB per image. You can upload up to 20 images at once.

**Q: Is my image data safe?** A: Yes! All data is encrypted at rest and in
transit. We use Cloudflare R2 for secure cloud storage. Images are private by
default. See our Privacy Policy at `/privacy` for complete details.

**Q: What's the difference between Spike Land and Pixel?** A: Spike Land is the
platform; Pixel is the AI image enhancement app that runs on Spike Land. Your
Spike Land account and tokens work across all apps on the platform.

### Token Questions

**Q: Do my auto-generated tokens expire?** A: Auto-generated tokens (1 per 15
minutes) are capped at 100. If you're inactive for 30 days, your token balance
may be adjusted. Purchased tokens and referral tokens never expire.

**Q: Can I transfer tokens to a friend?** A: No, tokens are account-specific and
cannot be transferred. However, you can use the referral program to give your
friend 50 tokens when they sign up.

**Q: Do purchased tokens expire?** A: No, purchased tokens never expire. Use
them anytime at your own pace.

**Q: What's the difference between FREE tier and TIER_1K?** A: Both output at
1024px resolution, but FREE tier uses a faster "nano" AI model with lower
quality, while TIER_1K uses the full Google Gemini AI model with better results.
FREE costs 0 tokens, TIER_1K costs 2 tokens.

**Q: Can I pause my subscription?** A: Yes, you can pause your subscription
through the subscription management page. No charges during pause, and you keep
all existing tokens.

### Enhancement Questions

**Q: Are my images private?** A: Yes, all images and albums are private by
default. Only you can access them unless you explicitly create and share a share
link.

**Q: What happens if an enhancement fails?** A: Tokens are automatically
refunded to your account immediately. You can retry the enhancement at no
additional cost. Check the error message for why it failed.

**Q: Can I enhance the same image multiple times?** A: Yes! You can enhance an
image as many times as you want. Each enhancement is saved in the version
history, and you can compare different tiers and pipelines.

**Q: What quality can I expect?** A: Results depend on your original image
quality and the tier you choose. Higher quality originals produce better
enhancements. The AI uses Google Gemini for intelligent upscaling and
enhancement. Try the FREE tier first to preview results.

**Q: Can I customize how images are enhanced?** A: Yes! Use Enhancement
Pipelines to customize the 4-stage process. Control analysis, auto-crop,
prompting, and generation settings. Create custom pipelines or fork existing
ones.

### Album & Sharing Questions

**Q: Why do I need to create an album before uploading?** A: Albums organize
your images and make it easy to manage, share, and batch-enhance multiple
images. All images must belong to an album.

**Q: Can others edit my shared albums?** A: No, shared albums are view-only.
Recipients cannot download, edit, or enhance images. You maintain full control.

**Q: How long do share links work?** A: Share links work indefinitely until you
delete the album or image. There's no expiration date.

**Q: Can I make my albums public?** A: Currently albums can be Private (only
you) or Unlisted (anyone with link). Public galleries are a future feature.

**Q: Can I password-protect shared albums?** A: Password protection for share
links is a planned future feature. Currently, albums are protected by obscure
share links.

### Referral Questions

**Q: How do I earn referral tokens?** A: Share your unique referral link from
the `/referrals` page. When a friend signs up using your link and verifies their
email, you both receive 50 tokens.

**Q: Is there a limit to referrals?** A: No limit! Refer as many friends as you
like and earn 50 tokens for each successful referral.

**Q: What if my friend already has an account?** A: Referral rewards only work
for new sign-ups. Existing users cannot be referred.

**Q: When do I receive referral tokens?** A: Tokens are credited immediately
after your friend verifies their email address. Check the referrals dashboard to
track status.

### Payment & Billing Questions

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?** A: We accept all major credit and
debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, etc.) through Stripe
payment processing.

**Q: Is my payment information secure?** A: Yes, all payments are processed by
Stripe, which is PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant (the highest security standard).
Spike Land never stores your full credit card details.

**Q: Can I get a refund?** A: Token purchases can be refunded within 30 days of
purchase. Contact support@spike.land with your transaction details. Subscription
cancellations are processed immediately, and you keep access until the end of
your billing period.

**Q: What happens to my tokens if I cancel my subscription?** A: You keep all
tokens (purchased, earned, and subscription tokens). Tokens never expire, so you
can use them anytime even after cancellation.

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues

**"File too large" error**

- Solution: Maximum 25 MB per file. Compress or resize your image.

**"Unsupported format" error**

- **Cause**: File type not supported
- **Solution**:
