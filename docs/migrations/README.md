# API Migration Guides

This directory contains step-by-step migration guides for API version changes.

## Overview

When breaking changes are made to the Spike Land API, migration guides are provided to help developers update their integrations smoothly.

## Current Migrations

| From         | To         | Status      | Guide |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| (Unreleased) | (None yet) | Not Started | N/A   |

## Migration Guide Template

New migration guides should follow the template in `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md`.

### Creating a New Migration Guide

1. Copy `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md` to `v[OLD]-to-v[NEW].md`
2. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with actual information
3. Document each breaking change with:
   - Before/after examples
   - Code migration examples
   - Common issues and solutions
4. Include comprehensive checklists
5. Publish guide on GitHub when API changes announced
