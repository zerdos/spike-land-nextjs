### 4. Architecture Flow

```
User Browser (localhost:3000/my-apps)
    ↓ Creates app with prompt
POST /api/apps
    ↓ Saves to DB + Enqueues to Redis
Redis Queue (app:${appId}:pending_messages)
    ↓ Polled by agent every 5 seconds
Agent Poll Script (yarn agent:poll)
    ↓ Spawns Claude CLI with MCP config
Claude CLI → MCP Server (@spike-npm-land/mcp-server)
    ↓ Calls codespace_update tool
Backend Worker (testing.spike.land)
    ↓ Transpiles & runs React code
POST /api/agent/apps/${appId}/respond
    ↓ Broadcasts via SSE
User Browser
    ↓ Receives update, iframe refreshes
Preview Displayed
```

## 📋 Manual Testing Required

### Why Manual Testing?

The Playwright MCP server encountered issues due to Chrome already being open. Manual testing is the most reliable approach for this verification task.

### Testing Checklist

#### Local Testing (5 Apps Required)

**Test 1: Simple Counter**

- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/my-apps`
- [ ] Click "Create New App"
- [ ] Enter: "Create a simple counter with increment and decrement buttons"
- [ ] Verify: Agent responds, preview shows working counter

**Test 2: Todo List**

- [ ] Create new app
- [ ] Enter: "Build a todo list app with add, delete, and mark complete features"
- [ ] Verify: Todo list is functional in preview

**Test 3: Color Picker**

- [ ] Create new app
- [ ] Enter: "Make a color picker with RGB sliders that shows the selected color"
- [ ] Verify: Sliders work, color updates in real-time

**Test 4: Image Gallery**

- [ ] Create new app
- [ ] Enter: "Create an image gallery with 6 placeholder images in a grid"
- [ ] Verify: Grid layout displays correctly

**Test 5: Calculator**

- [ ] Create new app
- [ ] Enter: "Build a simple calculator with basic math operations"
- [ ] Verify: Calculator functions correctly

#### Production Testing (5 Apps Required)

**Repeat the same 5 tests on:**

- [ ] Navigate to `https://spike.land/my-apps`
- [ ] Sign in if needed
- [ ] Create the same 5 apps
- [ ] Verify production agent polling processes them
- [ ] Verify previews load from https://testing.spike.land

### Critical Verification Points

For each app created, verify:

- [ ] **"Agent Working" badge** appears during processing
- [ ] **Agent Progress Indicator** shows stages (initialize → processing → complete)
- [ ] **Streaming response** appears in chat
- [ ] **Preview iframe** renders with working app
- [ ] **Live URL** works: `https://testing.spike.land/live/[codespace-id]/`
- [ ] **"Open in New Tab"** button functions
- [ ] **SSE updates** work in real-time
- [ ] **Version labeling** is correct when making follow-up requests

## 🎬 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Open Browser to My-Apps Page

**Local:**

```
http://localhost:3000/my-apps
```

**Production:**

```
https://spike.land/my-apps
```

### Step 2: Create First App (Counter Example)

1. Click **"Create New App"** button
2. System redirects to `/my-apps/[random-codespace-id]`
3. Enter prompt: **"Create a simple counter with increment and decrement buttons"**
4. Press **Enter** or click **"Start"** button
5. Observe the flow:
   - User message appears (right side, teal)
   - "Agent Working" badge appears
   - Agent progress indicator shows stages
   - Agent response streams in (left side, white)
   - Preview iframe appears with working counter
6. **Test the preview**: Click the + and - buttons
7. **Expand preview**: Click the preview to open modal
8. **Open in new tab**: Click "Open in New Tab" button

### Step 3: Create Follow-up Messages (Version Testing)

In the same app:

1. Send: **"Make the buttons bigger and change color to blue"**
2. Wait for agent response
3. Verify new preview appears (v2)
4. Send: **"Add a reset button that sets counter to 0"**
5. Wait for agent response
6. Verify third preview appears (v3, latest)
7. **Click on v1 preview** - verify it opens historical version
8. **Click on v2 preview** - verify it shows second iteration
9. **Latest preview** should be marked "(latest)"

### Step 4: Repeat for Remaining Apps

Create apps 2-5 following the same pattern:

- Todo List
- Color Picker
- Image Gallery
- Calculator

### Step 5: Verify Agent Logs (Optional Debugging)

If any issues occur:

```bash
# Check agent poll is processing
ps aux | grep agent:poll

# View queue status
yarn agent:poll --stats

# Check terminal where agent:poll is running for logs
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Agent Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Message sent but no response after 2+ minutes

**Solutions:**

```bash
# 1. Check agent poll is running
ps aux | grep agent:poll

# 2. Check queue has messages
yarn agent:poll --stats

# 3. Restart agent polling
# Kill existing: pkill -f agent:poll
# Start fresh: yarn agent:poll
```

### Issue: Preview Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Chat works but iframe is blank

**Solutions:**

```bash
# 1. Test backend directly
curl https://testing.spike.land/live/[codespace-id]/

# 2. Check browser console for errors
# DevTools → Console

# 3. Verify codespace URL format
# Should be: https://testing.spike.land/live/[codespace-id]/
```

### Issue: SSE Connection Drops

**Symptoms:** Updates stop appearing, need refresh

**Solutions:**

- Refresh the page
- Check Network tab for EventSource connection
- Verify `/api/apps/[id]/messages/stream` is active
