**Created**: 2026-01-29
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Create comprehensive blog article and marketing materials to announce Spike Land's pivot from "Vibe Coded Apps with Claude Code" to "AI-Powered Social Media Command Center". This is the final phase of a 10-phase epic and serves as the public launch announcement.

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (writing, reviewing, polishing)
**Dependencies**: None (all previous phases complete)

---

## Context & Background

### The Pivot Story

From issue #836, Spike Land is pivoting from:

- **Old positioning**: "Spike Land - Vibe Coded Apps with Claude Code"
- **New positioning**: "Spike Land - AI-Powered Social Media Command Center"

**Core insight from the pivot**: "You can build the best vibe coding app - if no one knows about it, you're doomed."

Zoltan built a great technical platform (Pixel, live coding, MCP servers) but struggled with discoverability. To solve his own marketing problem, he built Orbit - an AI-powered social media management tool. The realization: the solution to his problem IS the product.

### Target Audience

Per #836, three primary personas:

1. **Solo Content Creator** (25-35, manages 3-5 accounts)
2. **Small Business Marketing Manager** (28-45, manages brand presence)
3. **Freelance Social Media Manager** (25-40, multiple clients)

### Brand Voice

Established from existing blog posts (e.g., "My PRs Were Pure AI Slop", "Brighton, Dogs, and ADHD"):

- Personal, honest, vulnerable
- Short sentences, simple language
- Real stories, not corporate speak
- Self-aware about mistakes
- UK English spelling

## Voice & Style Guidelines

**Must follow** (based on existing blog posts):

1. **Sentence structure**:
   - Short sentences
   - One idea per sentence
   - Paragraphs of 2-4 sentences max

2. **Tone**:
   - Honest (admit mistakes)
   - Personal (I, me, my)
   - Relatable (developer who struggles)
   - Optimistic (but realistic)

3. **Word choice**:
   - Simple, clear language
   - UK English (realised, colour, centre)
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary
   - Active voice

4. **Story elements**:
   - Real anecdotes
   - Specific details
   - Emotional moments
   - Learning points

**Examples from existing posts**:

- "I need to tell you something. Something I am not proud of."
- "Let me tell you what building a startup looks like when your brain works differently."
- "This is the reality of building while working. Some weeks I make huge progress. Other weeks I make none."

## Content Angle: The Honest Pivot

**Core narrative**: Developer builds great product, learns hard lesson about marketing, builds solution to his own problem, realizes the solution IS the product.

**Emotional arc**:

1. Pride (built amazing tech)
2. Frustration (nobody finds it)
3. Realization (marketing is the real problem)
4. Action (build Orbit to solve it)
5. Epiphany (this is the actual product)
6. Commitment (3-month marketing push)

**Differentiation from competitors**:

- Built by someone who felt the pain
- Not a marketing expert selling to developers
- A developer selling to creators/marketers
- Product born from real need, not market research

---

## Key Messaging Points

### For the Blog Post

1. **Technical credibility**: Built real products (Pixel, MCP servers, live coding)
2. **Marketing reality**: Great product ≠ users without marketing
3. **Personal growth**: Learned hard lesson, built solution
4. **Product value**: Orbit solves real problem he experienced
5. **Vision**: 3-month push to prove it works

### For Product Hunt

1. **Unique value prop**: AI manages your entire social media presence
2. **Target users**: Creators, small businesses, freelancers
3. **Key features**: Scheduling, A/B testing, analytics, AI content
4. **Pricing**: $29/mo (vs. competitors at $99+)

### For Social Media

1. **Hook**: "I built the perfect developer tool - then realized nobody could find it"
2. **Problem**: Marketing is harder than coding
3. **Solution**: AI-powered social media command center
4. **Call to action**: Try Spike Land / Join early access

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Voice inconsistency**
   - Risk: New blog post doesn't match established style
   - Mitigation: Review 3+ existing posts before writing, use same sentence structure

2. **Message confusion**
   - Risk: Readers unclear if Spike Land is dev tool or social media tool
   - Mitigation: Clear positioning statement, explain pivot explicitly

3. **Launch timing**
   - Risk: Competing with major launches on Product Hunt
   - Mitigation: Research PH calendar, choose optimal Tuesday-Thursday

4. **Over-promising**
   - Risk: Marketing claims exceed current product capabilities
   - Mitigation: Based on #836, Orbit features are already built (phases 1-9 complete)

## Out of Scope

Per issue #846, the following are explicitly out of scope:

1. **Actual ad spend/campaign execution** - Planning only, not implementation
2. **Ongoing content marketing beyond initial launch** - First 3 months only
3. **Product development** - Content only, no code changes
4. **Customer acquisition beyond organic** - Planning for paid ads, not running them
5. **Analytics implementation** - Assuming tracking already exists from phases 1-9

---

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required before implementation

- [x] Phase 1-9 of #836 complete (per issue, only Phase 1 checked)
- [ ] Orbit features functional (scheduling, A/B testing, analytics)
- [ ] Spike Land branding updated (from Phase 2)
- [ ] Subscription tiers implemented (from Phase 3)

**Note**: This plan assumes Phases 2-9 will be complete before Phase 10 implementation.

### Information needed

1. Screenshots of Orbit features (for Product Hunt)
2. Demo video or GIF (for Product Hunt)
3. Early user testimonials (if available)
4. Current metrics (users, engagement, etc.)
5. Pricing finalized ($29 Pro / $99 Business from #836)

---

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Publish blog post** to spike.land/blog
2. **Submit to Product Hunt** on chosen launch day
3. **Post social content** following schedule
4. **Monitor engagement** and respond
5. **Iterate based on feedback** (what resonates, what doesn't)
6. **Track metrics** defined in launch sequence
7. **Prepare follow-up content** (case studies as customers come in)

---

## Notes for Implementer

### Writing the Blog Post

**Start here**: Read these existing posts to internalize voice:

1. `docs/blog/13-brighton-dogs-adhd-startup.md` - Personal, honest tone
2. `docs/blog/01-my-prs-were-pure-ai-slop.md` - Confession, learning
3. `docs/blog/14-why-i-still-code-when-ai-better.md` - Reflective, real

**Structure approach**:

- Write freely first (don't edit while drafting)
- Let the story flow naturally
- Edit for voice consistency second pass
- Final pass: check UK English, sentence length

**Avoid**:

- Corporate speak ("leverage", "synergy", "solutions")
- Hype without substance
- Promises not backed by existing features
- Generic startup clichés

**Include**:

- Specific product names (Pixel, Orbit, Spike Land)
- Real challenges faced
- Technical details (MCP servers, Claude Code)
- Honest admission (marketing was missing)
- Personal commitment (3-month push)

### Product Hunt Tips

**Best practices** (from PH playbook):

- Launch Tuesday-Thursday
- 00:01 PST for max visibility
- Respond to ALL comments quickly
- Thank supporters publicly
- Don't ask for upvotes directly
- Engage authentically

**Competition research**:

- Check PH for similar launches
- Note what worked (messaging, visuals)
- Differentiate clearly

### Social Media Strategy

**Platform priorities** (from #836 personas):

1. **Instagram/TikTok** - Primary (content creators)
2. **LinkedIn** - Secondary (business managers)
3. **Twitter/X** - Secondary (tech community)
4. **Facebook** - Tertiary (small business)

**Content types by platform**:

- Instagram: Visual transformations, before/after
- TikTok: Short story format, authentic
- LinkedIn: Business case, ROI focus
- Twitter: Thread format, technical depth
