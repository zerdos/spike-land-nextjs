  As an authenticated user
  I want to review my app details before submitting
  So that I can ensure everything is correct before creating the app

    And I navigate to the app creation wizard

  @fast @unit
  Scenario: Review step displays all entered data
    Given I complete all wizard steps with valid data
    Then I should see the wizard step "Review"
    And I should see the review section "Basic Info"
    And I should see the review section "Requirements"
    And I should see the review section "Monetization"
    And I should see the "Submit" button

  @fast @unit
  Scenario: Review shows correct Basic Info
    Given I complete all wizard steps with name "My App" and description "App Description"
    Then the review should show app name "My App"
    And the review should show description "App Description"
