# Story-Driven Development

Translate an idea into user stories, implement each as an MCP tool, test at unit speed, then render UI as a thin layer. The MCP tools become the specification layer — they define what the app does before any UI exists.

**The chain:** Idea → User Stories → MCP Tools + Unit Tests → Agent Verification → UI

## Phase 1: Discover

Turn the user's idea into structured user stories. See [references/user-stories.md](references/user-stories.md) for format and examples.

1. Ask clarifying questions about **who** (role), **what** (action), **why** (benefit)
2. Write stories: "As a [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]"
3. Define acceptance criteria as testable conditions for each story
4. Group stories into categories (these become MCP tool categories)
5. Map each story to a tool name using `verb_noun` convention
6. **Present stories to user for approval before proceeding**

## Phase 2: Specify

Translate each approved user story into an MCP tool. See [references/tool-pattern.md](references/tool-pattern.md) for the full template.

For each story, define three things (the "Three Players"):

| Player | What it constrains | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Name** | What the tool does (and doesn't do) | `update_user_email` |
| **Schema** | What inputs are valid | `z.string().email()` |
| **Handler** | What behavior is guaranteed | Returns `CallToolResult` |

Each constrains the other two. A well-named tool with a tight schema almost writes its own handler.

Quick reference for the tool skeleton:

```typescript
registry.register({
  name: "verb_noun",
  description: "User story in plain language",
  category: "category-name",
  tier: "free",
  inputSchema: MySchema.shape,  // .shape, not the schema itself
  handler: async (args): Promise<CallToolResult> => {
    // Business logic
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] };
  },
});
```

## Phase 3: Verify

Write unit tests for each MCP tool. See [references/test-pattern.md](references/test-pattern.md) for the full template.

Test structure per tool:
1. **Registration** — correct number of tools registered, correct names
2. **Happy path** — valid input produces expected output
3. **Error cases** — invalid input, missing auth, DB failures → `{ isError: true }`
4. **Edge cases** — quota limits, already-deleted items, concurrent access

Run tests: `yarn vitest run path/to/tools/my-tool.test.ts`

These tests run in milliseconds. They never flake. They test the same business logic that E2E tests would, without a browser.

## Phase 4: Agent Test

The agent exercises the MCP tools directly as integration testing. See [references/agent-testing.md](references/agent-testing.md) for the approach.

Since MCP is the agent's native interface, it can:
- Call tools in sequence to simulate real user flows
- Verify responses make sense and chain correctly
- Catch issues unit tests miss: multi-tool flows, real data shapes, auth context
- Document unexpected behaviors, suggest fixes, re-run after fixes

## Phase 5: Render

Build UI as a thin rendering layer on top of the already-tested business logic.

- UI components call the **same service functions** the MCP handlers call
- E2E tests cover only visual/rendering concerns (layout, animations, hydration)
- The MCP tools already proved the business logic works
- Keep Playwright tests for: visual regressions, browser-specific behavior, CORS/auth middleware

## Checklist

- [ ] User stories approved before implementation
- [ ] Each story maps to exactly one MCP tool
- [ ] Tool names are `verb_noun`, descriptions are plain language
- [ ] Zod schemas use `.describe()` on every field
- [ ] Handler returns `CallToolResult` (success and error paths)
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy path, errors, and edge cases
- [ ] Tests pass: `yarn vitest run`
- [ ] Category added to `CATEGORY_DESCRIPTIONS` in `tool-registry.ts`
- [ ] Registration function called in `mcp-server.ts`
- [ ] Agent tested the tools by calling them directly
