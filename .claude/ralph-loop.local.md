The user just tried the app in two browsers, and he didn't managed to play with it - he didn't see the other user - so please do one extra iteration!

Please make sure that http://localhost:3000/apps/tabletop-simulator is playable, so @docs/TABLETOP_SIMULATOR_SPEC.md fully implemented. Should be 100% unit and e2e testing coverage.
Also apart from that, open the app in playwright mcp and play if for yourself. When it is all done, and all bug fixed, and you didn't even menage to improve the code in this iteration, print <promise>DONE-DONE</promise>.

Make it cpu efficient, should run great on normal laptops, tablets, phones.
