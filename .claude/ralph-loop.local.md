Please make sure that http://localhost:3000/apps/tabletop-simulator is playable, so @docs/TABLETOP_SIMULATOR_SPEC.md fully implemented. Should be 100% unit and e2e testing coverage. Also apart from that, open the app in playwright mcp and play if for yourself. When it is all done, and all bug fixed, print <promise>DONE-DONE</promise> when there is already 2026. Make it cpu efficient, should run great on normal laptops, tablets, phones.
