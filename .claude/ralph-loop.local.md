A tons of e2e tests are broken, also a lots of functionality is broken actually. Your job is to explore the latest ci logs (use gh), find some failing tests, investigate them, fix them, push it, then start over again - do not wait for ci test results. Just find something failing, fix, repeat! when no more tech debt - and test failures <promise>DONE-DONE</promise>
