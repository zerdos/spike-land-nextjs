# QA Testing (Playwright)

High-signal, cost-aware E2E testing for web applications.

Core docs:

- https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices
- https://playwright.dev/docs/locators
- https://playwright.dev/docs/test-retries
- https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer
- https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding
- https://playwright.dev/docs/ci

## Defaults (2026)

- Keep E2E thin: protect critical user journeys only; push coverage down (unit/integration/contract).
- Locator priority: `getByRole` → `getByLabel`/`getByText` → `getByTestId` (fallback).
- Waiting: rely on Playwright auto-wait + web-first assertions; no sleeps/time-based waits.
- Isolation: tests must run alone, in parallel, and in any order; eliminate shared mutable state.
- Flake posture: retries are a debugging tool; treat rerun-pass as a failure signal and fix root cause.
- CI posture: smoke gate on PRs; shard/parallelize regression on schedule; always keep artifacts (trace/video/screenshot).

## Quick Start

| Command                                  | Purpose                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `npm init playwright@latest`             | Initialize Playwright   |
| `npx playwright test`                    | Run all tests           |
| `npx playwright test --grep @smoke`      | Run smoke tests         |
| `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | Run a single project    |
| `npx playwright test --ui`               | Debug with UI mode      |
| `npx playwright test --debug`            | Step through a test     |
| `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`    | Inspect trace artifacts |
| `npx playwright show-report`             | Inspect HTML report     |

## When to Use

- E2E tests for web applications
- Test user authentication flows
- Verify form submissions
- Test responsive designs
- Automate browser interactions
- Set up Playwright in CI/CD

## When NOT to Use

| Scenario      | Use Instead                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit testing  | Jest, Vitest, pytest                                             |
| API contracts | [qa-api-testing-contracts](../qa-api-testing-contracts/SKILL.md) |
| Load testing  | k6, Locust, Artillery                                            |
| Mobile native | Appium                                                           |

## Authoring Rules

### Locator Strategy

```typescript
// 1. Role locators (preferred)
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Sign in" }).click();

// 2. Label/text locators
await page.getByLabel("Email").fill("user@example.com");

// 3. Test IDs (fallback)
await page.getByTestId("user-avatar").click();
```

### Flake Control

- Avoid sleeps; use Playwright auto-wait
- Use retries as signal, not a crutch
- Capture trace/screenshot/video on failure
- Prefer user-like interactions; avoid `force: true`

## Workflow

- Write the smallest test that proves the user outcome (intent + oracle).
- Stabilize locators and assertions before adding more steps.
- Make state explicit: seed per test/worker, clean up deterministically, mock third-party boundaries.
- In CI: shard/parallelize, capture artifacts, and fail fast on rerun-pass flakes.

## Debugging Checklist

If something is flaky:

- Open trace first; identify whether it is selector ambiguity, missing wait, or state leakage.
- Replace brittle selectors with semantic locators; replace sleeps with `expect(...)` or a targeted wait.
- Reduce global timeouts; add scoped timeouts only when the product truly needs it.
- If it only fails in CI, look for concurrency, cold-start, CPU starvation, and environment differences.

## Do / Avoid

- Make tests independent and deterministic
- Use network mocking for third-party deps
- Run smoke E2E on PRs; full regression on schedule

- "Test everything E2E" as default
- Weakening assertions to "fix" flakes
- Auto-healing that weakens assertions
