# [Story] ORB-061: Create Fatigue Detector

## Parent Epic

Parent: #520 (Creative Factory)

## Description

Implement creative fatigue detection system that tracks performance decay, alerts on fatigue indicators, suggests refresh timing, and analyzes historical patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Track creative performance metrics over time with decay curve visualization
- [ ] Automated alerts when engagement drops below configurable thresholds
- [ ] Refresh timing suggestions based on audience size and frequency
- [ ] Historical pattern analysis showing typical creative lifespan by type
- [ ] Recommendations for which creative elements to refresh vs replace

## Technical Notes

- Implement rolling window analysis for detecting performance trends
- Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify sudden performance drops
- Create fatigue score combining CTR decay, frequency cap data, and engagement trends
