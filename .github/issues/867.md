# Feature: Calendar Publishing Cron Job

## User Request

Implement cron job for publishing scheduled posts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create cron API route for publishing scheduled posts
- [ ] Implement platform-specific publishing logic
- [ ] Add retry mechanism (max 3 retries)
- [ ] Update post status (PUBLISHED/FAILED)
- [ ] E2E calendar publishing scenarios pass

## Technical Approach

- Create cron route at `src/app/api/cron/publish-scheduled-posts/route.ts`
- Create publishing logic in `src/lib/calendar/publishing.ts`
- Query scheduled posts where publish_time <= now and status = SCHEDULED
- Publish to connected platforms via their APIs

## Files Expected to Change

- src/app/api/cron/publish-scheduled-posts/route.ts (CREATE)
- src/lib/calendar/publishing.ts (CREATE)

## Out of Scope

- Actual platform API integrations (mock for now)
