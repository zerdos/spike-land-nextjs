# [Story] ORB-042: Create Workflow data model

## Parent Epic

Parent: #515 (Epic 3.3: Orchestration Canvas)

## Description

Design and implement the data model for the workflow orchestration system, supporting complex automation sequences with triggers, actions, and conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow entity with triggers and actions collections
- [ ] WorkflowStep entity with sequence ordering and dependencies
- [ ] Condition branching support (if/else, switch)
- [ ] Workflow versioning for safe editing and rollback
- [ ] Workflow execution state tracking

## Technical Notes

- Use Prisma schema with JSON fields for flexible step configuration
- Design for horizontal scalability of workflow execution
- Consider workflow DSL for import/export capabilities
