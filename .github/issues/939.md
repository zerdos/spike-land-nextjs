# Feature: Implement Real Platform APIs replacing Stubs

## User Request
Real platform API implementations (currently stubs)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify all current API stubs for platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Meta)
- [ ] Replace stubs with actual API calls using valid credentials
- [ ] Handle rate limiting and authentication errors
- [ ] Ensure data mapping from real API matches the stub interface

## Technical Approach
Integrate official SDKs or HTTP clients for each platform. Authenticate using OAuth or API keys stored in environment variables.

## Files Expected to Change
- packages/testing.spike.land/src/routes/platform/*.ts
- src/services/platform-service.ts

## Out of Scope
- Creating new platform integrations not currently stubbed
