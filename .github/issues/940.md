# Feature: Enhanced Frontend UI with shadcn/ui

## User Request

Enhanced frontend UI with shadcn/ui

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit current UI components that are basic or inconsistent
- [ ] Replace custom/messy components with shadcn/ui components (Buttons, Cards, Dialogs, Inputs)
- [ ] Apply consistent theming across the application
- [ ] Improve capability and accessibility of the UI

## Technical Approach

Install shadcn/ui components via CLI or copy them to components/ui. Refactor existing pages to leverage these new components.

## Files Expected to Change

- src/components/ui/*.tsx
- src/app/**/*.tsx

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of the application flow, strictly UI enhancement
