# [Story] ORB-055: Implement multi-workspace management

## Parent Epic

Parent: #519 (Agency Features)

## Description

Build multi-workspace management capabilities allowing agencies to switch between client workspaces, view aggregate dashboards, generate cross-workspace reports, and perform bulk operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workspace switcher with quick access to recent and favorited workspaces
- [ ] Aggregate dashboard showing KPIs across all managed workspaces
- [ ] Cross-workspace reporting with customizable metrics and date ranges
- [ ] Bulk operations for scheduling, publishing, and content management across workspaces
- [ ] Role-based access control per workspace with inheritance options

## Technical Notes

- Implement workspace context provider for React components with lazy loading
- Use database views for aggregate queries to optimize performance
- Cache workspace metadata to enable fast switching without API calls
