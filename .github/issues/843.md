# [Phase 7] AI Image Generation for Posts

## Parent Epic
Part of #836 - Spike Land Pivot

## User Request
Integrate AI image generation into Orbit post composer

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add image generation dialog to post composer
- [ ] Add image enhancement dialog
- [ ] Create brand-aware prompt builder
- [ ] Connect to existing `/api/mcp/generate` endpoint
- [ ] Use Brand Brain settings for brand-aware prompts
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% coverage
- [ ] CI/CD passes

## Technical Approach
- Integrate with existing Pixel image generation capabilities
- Use Brand Brain personality/voice settings to inform prompts
- Support both generation and enhancement of images

## New Components
```
src/components/orbit/composer/
├── ImageGenerationDialog.tsx
├── ImageEnhancementDialog.tsx
└── BrandImagePromptBuilder.tsx
```

## Files Expected to Change
- `src/components/orbit/composer/*.tsx` (NEW/Modified)
- Integration with existing `/api/mcp/generate` endpoint

## Out of Scope
- Vibe coding integration (Phase 8)
- Documentation updates (Phase 9)
