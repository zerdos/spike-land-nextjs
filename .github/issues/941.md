# Feature: E2E Tests for Full Conversion Workflow

## User Request

E2E tests for full conversion workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define the full conversion workflow steps (e.g., Landing -> Sign up -> Action -> Success)
- [ ] Create a Cucumber/Playwright test suite covering this flow
- [ ] Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Verify success scenarios and common failure paths

## Technical Approach

Add a new .feature file in e2e/features/ describing the conversion scenarios. Implement step definitions in e2e/step-definitions/.

## Files Expected to Change

- e2e/features/conversion-workflow.feature
- e2e/step-definitions/conversion-steps.ts

## Out of Scope

- Unit tests for individual components (focus on E2E)
