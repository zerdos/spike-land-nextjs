# Bug: TypeScript build fails - Cannot find module '@spike-npm-land/shared/types'

## Summary

The production build is failing with a TypeScript error. The `TransitionFlow.tsx` component imports from a non-existent module path.

## Error Details

```
./src/components/admin/marketing/journey/TransitionFlow.tsx:4:41
Type error: Cannot find module '@spike-npm-land/shared/types' or its corresponding type declarations.

> 4 | import type { PlatformTransition } from "@spike-npm-land/shared/types";
    |                                         ^
```

## Affected File

- `src/components/admin/marketing/journey/TransitionFlow.tsx:4`

## CI Run

- Failed run: https://github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/actions/runs/21482321725
- Workflow: Build Application

## Root Cause Analysis

The Attribution Studio feature (#912) introduced this component but used an incorrect import path. The correct import should likely be:

- `@spike-npm-land/shared` (if types are exported from main entry)
- OR the type `PlatformTransition` needs to be defined/exported from the shared package

## Impact

- **P0: BLOCKING** - Production builds are failing
- Vercel deployment error (dpl_66JopoBuUetKw7n6kxAuiXuq9vss)

## Proposed Fix

1. Check if `PlatformTransition` type exists in `packages/shared/src/types/`
2. If it exists, update the import path to use the correct module resolution
3. If it doesn't exist, define the type in the shared package and export it
