# [Phase 8] Vibe Coding Integration as Campaign Tools

## Parent Epic

Part of #836 - Spike Land Pivot

## User Request

Reposition vibe coding as secondary feature for building campaign tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update My Apps messaging to "Build Custom Tools"
- [ ] Create link-in-bio template
- [ ] Create campaign landing page template
- [ ] Create interactive poll template
- [ ] Create contest entry template
- [ ] Add WorkspaceApp model to connect apps to workspaces
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% coverage
- [ ] CI/CD passes

## Technical Approach

New CTA: "Build Custom Link-in-Bio Pages, Interactive Polls, and Campaign Microsites"

New Prisma model:

```prisma
model WorkspaceApp {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  workspaceId   String
  appId         String
  purpose       String?  // "link-in-bio", "landing-page"
  linkedCampaign String?
}
```

## Pre-built Templates

```
src/app/my-apps/templates/
├── link-in-bio/
├── campaign-landing/
├── interactive-poll/
└── contest-entry/
```

## Files Expected to Change

- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `src/app/my-apps/page.tsx`
- `src/app/my-apps/templates/*.tsx` (NEW)

## Out of Scope

- Documentation updates (Phase 9)
- Blog article (Phase 10)
