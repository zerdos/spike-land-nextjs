# [Phase 2] Navigation Restructure - Make Orbit Primary

## Overview
Part of Epic #836 - Phase 2

Make Orbit the primary navigation focus, demote 'My Apps' to secondary.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update root layout navigation to prioritize Orbit
- [ ] Create workspace onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Update authentication redirect to go to Orbit
- [ ] All navigation components tested
- [ ] E2E tests pass

## Technical Approach
1. Update `src/app/layout.tsx` navigation order
2. Create `src/app/orbit/onboarding/page.tsx` for workspace wizard
3. Update `src/auth.ts` redirect logic
4. Update `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` post-login redirect

## Files Expected to Change
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/orbit/page.tsx`
- `src/app/orbit/onboarding/page.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/orbit/workspace-wizard.tsx` (new)
- `src/auth.ts`
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

## Testing Requirements
- E2E test for workspace creation flow
- E2E test for navigation accessibility
- Unit tests for navigation components

## Out of Scope
- Subscription implementation (Phase 3)
- Backend infrastructure changes
- Marketing materials

Resolves #836 (Phase 2)
