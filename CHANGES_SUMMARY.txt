# Dual Camera Fix - Files Changed

## Modified Files:
1. /Volumes/Dev/github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/fix-video-wall-issues/src/app/client/page.tsx
   - Changed peer references from single `peerRef` to `frontPeerRef` and `backPeerRef`
   - Updated `createCameraCall` to select the appropriate peer based on camera type
   - Rewrote peer initialization logic to create separate Peer instances for dual camera mode
   - Updated cleanup logic to destroy both peer instances

## Created Files:
1. /Volumes/Dev/github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/fix-video-wall-issues/DUAL_CAMERA_FIX_SUMMARY.md
   - Detailed explanation of the issue, root cause, and solution
   - Step-by-step breakdown of all changes made
   - Technical details about how the fix works

2. /Volumes/Dev/github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/fix-video-wall-issues/src/app/client/page.tsx.backup
   - Backup of the original file before changes

## Key Changes:

### Before:
- Single `peerRef` used for all camera connections
- Both cameras used the same Peer instance
- Display couldn't distinguish between the two camera streams

### After:
- Separate `frontPeerRef` and `backPeerRef`
- Each camera gets its own unique Peer instance with a unique ID
- Display can properly identify and display both camera streams simultaneously

## Build Status:
- Linting: PASS (2 warnings - safe to ignore)
- TypeScript compilation: PASS
- Next.js build: PASS
- Bundle size: No significant increase

## Testing Status:
- Code compiles successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- ESLint warnings are pre-existing and unrelated to this fix
- Ready for manual/E2E testing

## Next Steps:
1. Test dual camera mode manually
2. Verify both camera feeds appear on display
3. Test mode switching (single <-> dual)
4. Verify connection indicators show correct status
5. Test edge cases (reconnection, poor network, etc.)
