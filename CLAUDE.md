## 🎫 Ticket-Driven Development (BLOCKING REQUIREMENT)

**CRITICAL**: No code changes without a ticket. Every PR must trace back to documented requirements.

### Phase 0: Ticket Governance (BLOCKING)

#### Step 1: Investigate Project Board

```bash
# List all items in the project board
gh project item-list 2 --owner zerdos --format json

# Check for existing issues matching keywords
gh issue list --repo zerdos/spike-land-nextjs --search "<feature keywords>" --json number,title,body,state
```

#### Step 2: For Each Feature Request

**IF related ticket exists:**

```bash
gh issue edit <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Updated Requirements
<updated content here>
EOF
)"
```

**IF no ticket exists:**

```bash
gh issue create --repo zerdos/spike-land-nextjs \
  --title "Feature: <clear title>" \
  --body "## User Request
<original user request verbatim>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Technical Approach
<planned implementation>

## Files Expected to Change
- path/to/file1.ts

## Out of Scope
- Explicitly list what this ticket does NOT cover" \
  --label "feature" \
  --project "zerdos/2"
```

#### Step 3: Link & Confirm

- Output ticket URLs to user for approval before proceeding
- **WAIT** for user confirmation: "Tickets approved, proceed"

### Implementation Phases

1. **Discovery**: Read relevant docs ONLY after tickets exist
2. **Parallel Implementation**: Spawn subagents per ticket
3. **PR Review**: Verify traceability to acceptance criteria

### Feature Implementation Rules

- **TICKET FIRST**: Create/update GitHub issue BEFORE any code changes
- **USER APPROVAL**: Wait for user to confirm tickets before implementation
- **TRACEABILITY**: Every PR change must map to acceptance criteria
- **NO SCOPE CREEP**: Undocumented changes = blocked PR

---

## ⚠️ CI/CD Verification (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENTS:**

When working on this repository, you **MUST** follow this process for every code change:

1. **Push your changes** to a feature branch
2. **Create a Pull Request** (or push to existing PR)
3. **Wait for CI checks to start** - Don't assume success
4. **Monitor the CI pipeline** - Use `gh pr checks` or `gh run view`
5. **Verify ALL checks pass**:
   - ✅ Run Tests (unit tests with 100% coverage)
   - ✅ Build Application (Next.js build)
   - ✅ Deploy to Vercel Preview
   - ✅ E2E Tests (Playwright/Cucumber)
6. **Fix any failures immediately** - Do not leave failing CI
7. **Only consider the task complete** when all checks are green ✅

### How to Monitor CI Status

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER> --json statusCheckRollup

# View specific check details
gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>

# Watch a specific workflow run
gh run view <RUN-ID> --log-failed
```

**DO NOT mark a task as complete if:**

- CI is still running (status: IN_PROGRESS, PENDING)
- Any check has failed (conclusion: FAILURE)
- You haven't verified the status after pushing

---

## 🔥 Pre-Merge Smoke Test (MANDATORY)

Before merging ANY pull request, manually verify on the **Vercel preview URL**:

- [ ] Home page loads without errors
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] New/modified features work as expected
- [ ] Login flow works (if applicable)

Document the result in PR comments before merging.

## 🔧 GitHub CLI Orchestration

**CRITICAL**: This project uses GitHub as the single source of truth for all project management.

### Essential gh Commands

```bash
# Issues
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees
gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label "bug"
gh issue comment <number> --body "🤖 Starting work on this"
gh issue close <number> --comment "✅ Completed: <summary>"

# Projects
gh project item-list 2 --owner zerdos --format json
gh project item-add 2 --owner zerdos --url <issue-url>

# PRs
gh pr create --title "feat: <title> (#<number>)" --body "Resolves #<number>"
gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>
```

### Agent Workflow

**When starting a session:**

1. Check open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
2. Check project board: `gh project item-list 2 --owner zerdos`
3. Report status to user before asking what to work on

**When discovering work/bugs:**

1. Create an issue immediately: `gh issue create --label "agent-created"`
2. Add appropriate labels (bug, feature, tech-debt, p0, p1, p2)
3. Continue with current work - don't block on the discovery

**When completing work:**

1. Close issue: `gh issue close <n> --comment "✅ Done: <summary>"`
2. Link PR to issue: Include "Resolves #<n>" in PR description

### Labels

- `p0`, `p1`, `p2` - Priority levels
- `bug`, `feature`, `tech-debt` - Issue types
- `blocked`, `in-progress`, `agent-created` - Status

---

## 📁 Issue Management

### Resolving Project Issues

1. **Fetch open issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,author,body,url`

2. **Check authorship**:
   - **If created by `zerdos`**: Proceed automatically
   - **If created by someone else**: Ask user what to do

3. **Reference issues in commits and PRs** (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix authentication bug

   Resolves #123"

   gh pr create --title "Fix authentication bug (#123)" --body "Resolves #123"
   ```

## 🌳 Git Worktree Setup

This repository uses **git worktrees** for parallel development:

```
/Volumes/Dev/github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/
├── .bare/           # Bare repository (DO NOT work here directly)
└── main/            # Main branch worktree (primary working directory)
```

### Working with Worktrees

```bash
# Create new worktree for feature branch
cd /Volumes/Dev/github.com/zerdos/spike-land-nextjs/main
git worktree add ../feature-name -b feature-name

# Work in the new worktree
cd ../feature-name
yarn install
yarn dev

# Remove worktree when done
cd ../main && git worktree remove ../feature-name
```

### Best Practices

- **DO**: Create worktrees for feature branches from `main` worktree
- **DO**: Remove worktrees after merging
- **DON'T**: Make changes in `.bare/` directory
- **DON'T**: Create worktrees inside other worktrees

## 🛠️ Quick Reference

### Development Commands

```bash
yarn dev              # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
yarn build            # Build for production
yarn lint             # Run ESLint
yarn test:coverage    # Unit tests with 100% coverage
yarn test:e2e:local   # E2E tests (requires dev server)
```

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright + Cucumber
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel

### Directory Structure

```
src/
├── app/           # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/    # React components
│   └── ui/        # shadcn/ui components
└── lib/           # Utilities

e2e/
├── features/      # Cucumber feature files
└── step-definitions/  # Playwright steps
```

See [README.md](./README.md) for full development setup.

---

## ✅ Testing Requirements

- **100% code coverage required** for unit tests
- **Test files**: Place `.test.ts(x)` alongside source files
- **E2E tests**: Create `.feature` files in `e2e/features/`

---

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Agents must follow these rules:

1. **NEVER create .md files in project root** (except README.md and CLAUDE.md)
2. **All documentation goes in `docs/` directory**
3. **Update existing files** rather than creating duplicates
4. **Archive historical docs** in `docs/archive/`

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Coverage Not 100%

- Run `yarn test:coverage` to see uncovered lines
- Check `coverage/` for detailed HTML report

### E2E Tests Failing

- Ensure dev server is running: `yarn dev`
- Use `yarn test:e2e:local`
- Install browser: `yarn dlx playwright install chromium`

### CI/CD Failing

- Check Actions tab for logs
- Verify secrets are configured
- Ensure tests pass locally first
