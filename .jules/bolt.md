## 2026-02-13 - CI E2E Failures due to Memory Exhaustion
**Learning:** E2E tests in CI (GitHub Actions) running `next start` (production mode) were failing en masse with `ECONNRESET` and timeouts. This was traced to the Node process running the Next.js server running out of memory under the heavy load of concurrent tests. The `build` script had `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'`, but the runtime `start:e2e` script did not.
**Action:** Always ensure `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'` is set in `start:e2e` and `dev:ci` scripts in `package.json` to prevent server crashes during CI test execution.
