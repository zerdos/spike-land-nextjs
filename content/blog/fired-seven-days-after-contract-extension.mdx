The dates speak for themselves.

**January 2026**: I spend the month worried about whether my contract at Virgin Media O2 will be renewed. I am a contractor, placed through Hays recruitment agency. The uncertainty is constant.

**January 28, 2026, 13:21**: I receive the PayStream document titled "Hays Extension January 2026." My contract is extended. Relief.

**January 30, 2026**: HMRC has miscalculated my tax. I owe them five thousand pounds, due immediately. Based on the contract extension I received two days ago, I pay the full amount. This is 80% of my savings. I do not request a payment plan. I do not ask for an extension. Why would I? My income is secure. I just got it confirmed in writing.

I have ADHD. The urgency of the payment was driven by that — the need to resolve it immediately, to get it off my plate, not the rational thing to do. A neurotypical person might have waited, requested a payment plan, hedged. I saw an open loop and closed it. Two days later, that decision would look very different.

**February 4, 2026**: I receive this email from Hays:

> "Hi Zoltan, As per our conversation your contract at VMO2 has been terminated due to performance. Your end date is now 11/02/26."

Seven days. That is the gap between "your contract is extended" and "your contract is terminated."

Two days. That is the gap between paying HMRC everything I had and finding out I was out of work.

## The PRs That Would Not Merge

Let me tell you about "performance" at VMO2.

Every pull request I submitted required approval from both a tester and a different developer. Reasonable on paper. In practice, my PRs sat unreviewed for days. Sometimes a week. Sometimes longer.

I would open a PR. Wait. Message the team. Wait more. The testers had their own priorities. The other developers had their own work. My PRs accumulated in the queue like planes circling a closed airport.

The code was written. The implementation was complete. But none of that mattered because the process prevented it from shipping. Work that was done — genuinely done — sat idle because no one could find time to click "approve."

When reviews did come, they were cautious. Not cautious in the productive sense — the kind where someone catches a real bug or challenges a design decision. Cautious in the paralysed sense. No one wanted to approve anything that might change behaviour. No one wanted their name on a merge that could theoretically break something.

The meetings were worse. Rehashing the same points over and over again, talking about theories about how things should work instead of actually implementing them. This is code. It is implementation details. Yet the meetings debated abstract approaches endlessly while the concrete work sat unmerged in the PR queue.

I submitted refactoring PRs to clean up code that was becoming hard to maintain. These were blocked even faster than feature work. The implicit policy was clear: do not change anything unless you absolutely have to. Do not improve anything. Do not touch anything that works, even if "works" means "is slowly becoming unmaintainable."

This is the environment in which my "performance" was being evaluated.

## The Code That Even AI Could Not Tame (At First)

The VMO2 codebase was so complex, so tangled, that even Claude Opus 4.6 — the most capable AI coding model available — struggled with it. This is a model that routinely handles large, sophisticated codebases. At VMO2, it needed significant supervision to produce reliable results.

I did not walk away from the problem. I spent weeks building the scaffolding that made AI-assisted development possible in that environment. Detailed documentation of the system's architecture. Automated skills and tasks for Claude Code — the kind of structured context that turns an AI from a confused explorer into a productive contributor. Work that would have been extremely difficult to do manually.

By the time I was fired, my AI-augmented workflow was starting to deliver real results. I was terminated for "performance" at the exact moment my investment in tooling was beginning to pay off.

## You Cannot Automate Chaos

Around the same time I was being fired, a podcast deep dive about AI-powered development workflows was published. I am featured in it as the expert. The catchphrase of the episode is a quote from me: "[You cannot automate chaos](/blog/you-cannot-automate-chaos)."

I said that about codebases. About teams. About the idea that you can throw AI at a broken process and expect magic. You need clean foundations. You need fast CI. You need a culture where people are allowed to improve things.

I was talking about exactly the kind of environment I was working in at VMO2. A team where PRs were blocked for days. Where refactoring was forbidden. Where the process was designed to prevent change, not enable it.

You cannot automate chaos. And you cannot perform in a system that is designed to prevent performance.

## 1,000+ Roles: The Bigger Picture

My termination did not happen in isolation. In the same month:

- **January 14, 2026**: VMO2 [notified approximately 300 staff of potential redundancies](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2026/01/virgin-media-o2-notifies-some-uk-300-staff-of-potential-redundancies.html).
- **January 19, 2026**: VMO2 announced a [10-year, &pound;750M outsourcing deal](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2026/01/virgin-media-o2-uk-outsourcing-700-roles-to-tata-cs-and-tech-mahindra.html) with Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, affecting 790 roles.

Over 1,000 roles affected in a single month. "Performance" was organisational restructuring with a convenient label.

This is not a personal grievance. This is a pattern. UK telecom and enterprise IT are restructuring at scale. The roles are moving offshore, the budgets are tightening, and contractors are the first to go — often with a justification that deflects from the real reason.

If you are a hiring manager: look for the developers stuck in AI-phobic environments. The ones whose PRs sat unmerged for weeks. The ones who tried to introduce better tooling and were told not to rock the boat. These people can do 10x more with the right tools and culture. The restructuring is creating a talent pool that most companies are not seeing yet.

If you are a VMO2 employee or contractor: act now. The industry is shifting. Do not wait for the next round of redundancies to start planning your next move.

## How Enterprise Teams Treat Contractors

Every contractor in the UK knows this but rarely says it out loud.

You are not a real person to the company. You are a line item. A resource that can be switched on and off with a one-week notice period and a politely worded email from the recruitment agency.

The team you work with every day, the people you message on Slack, the stand-ups you attend — none of that creates any obligation. When the decision is made, it is made somewhere above you, communicated to the agency, and the agency sends you a paragraph.

This is the deal. I knew it when I signed up. Every contractor knows it.

But the timing matters. If VMO2 had decided in January — before the extension — that my performance was insufficient, I would have had more time to prepare. I would have started looking for new work a month earlier. And critically, I would not have paid HMRC five thousand pounds in a lump sum two days before losing my income. I would have requested a payment plan instead.

The extension was signed on January 28. The termination came on February 4. Either they decided to fire me after extending my contract, which raises questions about their internal communication. Or they knew before the extension and signed it anyway, which raises different questions.

I do not know which one is true. Both are bad.

## The Numbers

My day rate as a contractor has not increased in three years at Virgin Media. IT contractor rates have broadly stagnated across the industry, and the reason is not hard to see: the market is questioning the value of manual coding in an age where automation is changing what developers actually do. The same day rate I earned when I started at VMO2 is the same day rate I was earning when they fired me. During that time, the cost of living in the UK has risen by roughly 30%.

After paying HMRC, I have approximately two months of savings. I have a puppy named Pixel that needs feeding. I have rent in Brighton.

I could sell my laptop. I could sell my bicycle. I am publishing this before applying for any financial aid. These are facts, not a sympathy play. I am sharing them because every contractor needs to understand how fragile this arrangement is. One bad-faith extension, one tax bill, one seven-day reversal, and you are looking at your bank balance wondering how you got here.

## What I Am Doing Now

I run a company called SPIKE LAND LTD. It is registered in the UK, company number 16906682. I am building [spike.land](https://spike.land) — an open-source, AI-powered development platform. The entire source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/zerdos/spike.land).

The thesis is simple. The bottleneck in modern software development is not writing code. It is everything around the code. The blocked PRs. The week-long review cycles. The fear of refactoring. The meetings about meetings. The culture of risk avoidance that turns competent developers into ticket-processing machines.

AI can help with all of this. Not by replacing developers, but by removing the friction that prevents them from doing their actual work. Fast CI. Automated quality checks. Intelligent code review. Real-time collaboration without the ceremony.

The industry is changing. The teams that cling to manual reviews, manual testing, manual deployment ceremonies are not protecting quality. They are paying more to move slower.

I wrote in [You Cannot Automate Chaos](/blog/you-cannot-automate-chaos) about learning to use AI tools properly — about how you need to understand the system before you try to improve it. That lesson still holds. But I am now applying it to a bigger problem.

I do not want to build another tool that makes a broken process slightly faster. I want to build something that makes the broken process unnecessary.

## The Bet

If this article goes viral, my tool goes viral. That is the bet.

spike.land is open source on GitHub. Anyone can clone it. Run it locally. See what AI-assisted development looks like in practice. This is not vapourware. It is working software, built by one developer with ADHD and a dog named Pixel in Brighton.

For every contractor who has been in this position — the system is not designed for you. It is designed for the convenience of the organisation, and when it is convenient to remove you, you will be removed. The extension you just received is not a guarantee. The approval on your timesheet is not loyalty. The friendly Slack messages are not job security.

Protect yourself. Keep your savings higher than you think you need. Negotiate payment plans with HMRC when you can. Do not make financial decisions based on a contract extension until you have been paid under it for at least a month.

And build something of your own. Even if it is small. Even if it does not make money yet. Because the only contract that cannot be terminated by a one-paragraph email from a recruitment agency is the one you write yourself.

The best way to support a developer is to use their work. The source code is open. Clone it. Run it. Welcome to the singularity — where things do not make much sense anymore.

I have a puppy, two months of savings, and a platform to build. Let's go.
