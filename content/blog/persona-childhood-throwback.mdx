Last month, my mum called me with that tone of voice that means something's about to change your Saturday.

"I'm organizing the attic," she said. "There are about fifteen boxes of photographs. Most of them are yours."

Most of them are mine.

Three decades of my life, in deteriorating cardboard boxes, in a dark attic. Waiting.

## The Physical Archive

Here's the thing about the 90s and 2000s: nobody took digital photos. Or rather, some people did, but they took maybe three per year. The rest of us had actual film. Disposable cameras. Kodak moment cameras. Photos that existed in the physical world.

My parents documented everything. Or at least, everything they thought was important. School photos. Birthday parties. Holidays. Random moments at the park.

I have a photo of myself at age four, standing in front of a Christmas tree. I have photos of my best friend and me at sleepover in 1997, both of us grinning with questionable braces. I have photos from summer camp, from family road trips, from the day my baby brother was born.

But here's the problem: I can barely see any of it.

The photos are faded. The colors have drained to weird yellows and pinks. Some of them are creased from being handled too much. Some are faded from sun exposure. One entire box was damaged by water damage years ago, and the photos look almost like ghosts of themselves.

It's like looking at your own history through a cloudy window.

## The Scanning Marathon

I spent a weekend scanning everything. Not professionally—just my old flatbed scanner and a lot of patience. I got through maybe 200 photos before my scanner started making angry noises.

The digital versions were, unfortunately, exactly as bad as the originals. If anything, scanning had compressed the detail further. I had these low-res, yellowed images of my entire childhood, and looking at them made me sad.

I couldn't see my own face clearly. I couldn't remember what my childhood home actually looked like. The photos were there, but they weren't really accessible. They were more like proof that something happened than actual memories.

I put the folder away and felt weirdly depressed about it.

## The Accidental Discovery

A friend mentioned using something called Pixel for old family photos, and I was skeptical. I mean, I'm aware of AI image upscaling. Most of it makes things look weird and plastic.

But I had nothing to lose, right? Just some bad scans of old photos.

I uploaded one: me at my cousin's wedding in 1998. I'm about five years old, wearing a dress I was very proud of. In the original scan, I'm kind of a blur. The dress is a brown smudge. You can barely make out my face.

I clicked enhance.

The app took maybe 15 seconds.

When the result loaded, I had to stand up and walk away from my computer for a minute.

My five-year-old face was suddenly clear. Not just clear—present. I could see the expression on my face. The detail on my dress. The color of it. The background came into focus. I could see my mom standing next to me.

I was looking at an actual memory, not a digital ghost.

## The Spiral

I spent the next two days uploading photos.

Photos from summer camp, age seven. I can now see the exact expression on my face when I was genuinely happy. I remember that feeling, and now I can see it.

Photos from a road trip to the Grand Canyon. My family standing in front of it. The photo was so faded I'd essentially forgotten what it looked like. Now I can see my dad's face clearly. He's smiling at my brother. It's been 25 years and I'd forgotten that moment, but here it is, restored to something approaching reality.

A photo from my twelfth birthday. All my friends at a sleepover, piled on my bed. Wild hair, questionable fashion choices, genuine joy. I can actually see everyone's faces now. I can remember who they are, where their lives went, which ones I'm still friends with.

It's like getting pieces of myself back.

## Why This Matters

Memory is a weird thing. You don't just remember events. You remember how they looked, how they felt, what the light was like.

But when your only record of an event is a blurry, faded photograph, the memory becomes corrupted. The photograph doesn't match what you remember feeling, so your brain slowly abandons the actual memory and replaces it with the bad image.

I think that's what happened to my childhood. I had memories, sure. But they were shadowed by the fact that the only evidence of those moments was barely visible.

Seeing the photos restored is like recovering the memories themselves.

I uploaded probably 150 photos in the first week. Each one is a small moment of clarity. A moment where something I'd half-forgotten suddenly comes back into focus.

## The Plan

I'm making a photo book. Not a fancy professional one—just something from one of those online services. But I'm going to include maybe 50 of these restored photos, chronologically from childhood through my teens.

My parents are going to get a copy. My mum cried when I showed her some of the restored versions of photos she'd taken. She said it was like remembering the day all over again.

I'm also keeping copies for myself. And someday, if I have kids, I'll show them. Not the faded originals, but the clear versions. They'll be able to see what their mom's childhood actually looked like.

That feels important. Not in a grand, life-changing way. Just in a way that says: your history matters, and it deserves to be seen clearly.

## The Nostalgia Era

We're at this interesting moment in history where everyone has thousands of digital photos, but there's also this huge archive of pre-digital memories that are slowly fading away.

The negatives are still intact, theoretically. But scanning them and having them look terrible isn't better than just leaving them in the box.

I was genuinely depressed about my childhood photos until I found a way to actually see them.

Now I'm obsessed with them. In a healthy way, I think. It's not about living in the past. It's about actually being able to access the memories instead of just pretending I have them.

If you have old photos—in boxes, in albums, in a storage unit—don't let them fade away completely. Find a way to see them again. Really see them.

Your childhood deserves that.
