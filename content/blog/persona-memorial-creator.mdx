My mother passed away on a Tuesday in March. I found out on Thursday. By Friday, I was organizing the memorial service, which would be on Monday.

Everything moved in a blur of phone calls and decisions. But among all the logistics, there was one thing I kept coming back to: the photos for the celebration of life slideshow.

Mum was 84 when she died. The photos that meant the most—the ones I wanted to display—were from decades ago. Her wedding in 1970. Her children being born. The family holidays in the 1980s. The Christmases when the house was full.

They were beautiful memories, but the photos looked like they'd aged as much as she had. Faded. Yellowed. Soft at the edges. They didn't do her justice.

## The Weight of This Moment

Planning a memorial service is strange because you're trying to honor someone while you're grieving them. Every choice feels important. Every detail matters because you know this is how people will remember the moment you said goodbye.

I spent that Saturday morning going through Mum's photo albums, carefully removing the ones that meant the most. I found maybe 20 photos that really captured who she was. Photos from when she was young and vibrant. From when the family was all together. From happy moments that deserved to be seen clearly.

But when I looked at them on my computer to prepare them for the slideshow, they broke my heart a little. They looked so faded. So aged. The colors had drained away. Her face, which I knew so well, was soft and unclear in these images.

I thought about what people would see: the slideshow would be the way people remembered her. Those faded photos would be their last impression, even though they showed moments when she was vivid and full of life.

I didn't know what to do. I didn't have time for professional restoration, and honestly, I didn't know where to start.

## Finding a Way

My daughter—who's much better with technology than I am—suggested we try something called Pixel. She'd seen it somewhere online, understood it worked on old photos, and suggested I try it.

I was skeptical. I've seen "enhanced" photos before. They looked wrong. Artificial. Overprocessed.

But we had nothing to lose and maybe six hours before we needed the slideshow finished.

I uploaded ten photos—the most important ones. The wedding photo. Christmas morning from 1982. Family holidays. Mum holding my granddaughter when she was first born.

## The Moment

The results came back in minutes, and I actually had to sit down.

The wedding photo—Mum in her wedding dress, Dad in his suit, the two of them laughing—was suddenly clear. You could see the detail of her dress properly. You could see the joy on both their faces. It wasn't artificially enhanced or oversaturated. It just looked like what it was: a beautiful moment, captured properly.

The 1982 Christmas photo, which had been almost sepia-toned from aging, came back in proper color. The tree had green again. The children's faces were clear. You could actually see what they were doing, what they were wearing, that moment of happiness.

The photo of Mum holding my newborn daughter—which had been grainy and soft—suddenly had detail. You could see the expression on Mum's face, that particular kind of joy that grandmothers have holding their first grandchild. It was so clear. So real.

I cried. I sat in my chair with the computer screen in front of me and cried, because these were memories I thought had been lost to time and aging, and suddenly they were found again.

## The Slideshow

We created the slideshow that afternoon. Ten restored photos, set to gentle music, playing as people arrived for the service.

I watched people's faces as they watched. Relatives saw photos they'd forgotten. Mum's oldest friend saw the wedding photo clear for the first time in 50 years. My cousins remembered holidays they'd nearly lost to the fading of prints.

The slideshow didn't just show photos. It showed her life in clarity. It showed moments of joy and connection and love, displayed with the respect they deserved.

At the reception afterward, someone asked me about the slideshow. "Those photos look so good. Did you find originals or something?"

I explained that they were from old prints, but restored. They looked astonished. "That's possible? That's amazing."

It felt important that people could see Mum clearly in those final images we shared of her. Not through the veil of decades and aging and fading. Just her, in moments that mattered, with the clarity they deserved.

## Why It Mattered

There's something about holding a memorial service. You're trying to honor someone. You're trying to show the world who they were. You want those final images to reflect the person you knew, not the distance of time and deterioration.

The restored photos did that. They brought her life into focus. Not changed. Not artificial. Just visible again.

In the chaos of grief and organizing and trying to make all the decisions that memorial services require, having a tool that could restore what time had faded was a mercy.

She deserved to be remembered clearly.
